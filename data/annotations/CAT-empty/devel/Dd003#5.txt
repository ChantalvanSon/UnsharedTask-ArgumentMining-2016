I
have
no
problem
with
Happy
Hours.
I
have
a
huge
problem
with
drunken
people
in
public
trying
to
control
a
moving
vehicle.
We
kill
35,000
people
on
the
roads
each
year,
making
terrorism
deaths
look
like
a
picnic
from
a
public
health
perspective
(though
clearly
not
to
those
affected.)
Perhaps
a
substantial
part
of
the
proceeds
from
liquor
licensing
should
go
to
the
hiring
of
additional
cops
to
station
in
neighborhoods
where
bars
are
common.
One
could
also
require
businesses
that
sell
alcohol
to
have
breathalyzers
and
post
a
sign
saying
that
by
entering
a
customer
agreed
to
a
breathalyzer
test
upon
leaving.
In
general,
however,
what
is
needed
is
much
greater
enforcement
of
our
traffic
laws
and
penalties
that
have
a
chance
to
be
effective
as
a
deterrent
across
the
board,
including
mandatory
jail
time
for
a
D.U.I.

Service
Makes
Sense

Happy
Hour
Bans
`

<EOS>
In
the
beginning
of
my
career
as
a
bartender
,
I
worked
in
a
solid
establishment
with
great
food
and
beverages
that
offered
a
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
I
appreciated
it
because
it
brought
in
clientele
fairly
early
in
the
evening
when
bars
are
often
quiet
.
<EOS>
During
that
hour
,
the
average
check
was
two
drinks
per
person
,
and
they
frequently
would
order
an
appetizer
.
<EOS>
After
it
was
over
,
some
guests
stayed
on
and
ordered
a
meal
.
<EOS>
But
more
often
than
not
,
many
of
the
guests
made
their
way
home
without
much
fanfare
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
happy
hour
or
not
,
the
one
thing
that
I
was
always
diligent
about
was
serving
water
and
frequently
checking
in
with
my
guests
to
make
sure
that
they
were
in
good
shape
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
owners
was
always
on-premise
and
frequently
checked
in
at
the
bar
to
ensure
all
was
going
well
.
<EOS>
In
general
,
offering
food
and
water
and
frequent
check-in
's
with
one
's
patrons
is
not
just
a
good
preventative
--
at
the
core
,
it
's
simply
responsible
hospitality
.
<EOS>
At
this
point
in
my
career
as
an
bar
owner
,
I
can
appreciate
it
for
similar
reasons
.
<EOS>
From
a
financial
perspective
,
bars
can
often
be
fairly
quiet
places
the
first
hour
or
two
after
opening
.
<EOS>
Now
,
when
various
states
are
considering
a
minimum
wage
increase
to
$
15
an
hour
,
a
short
selection
of
drinks
offered
at
a
slight
discount
can
help
to
stimulate
business
and
offset
costs
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
bit
narrowminded
to
think
that
a
happy
hour
ban
is
going
to
drastically
reduce
problems
.
<EOS>
An
establishment
that
offers
food
can
avoid
happy
hour
restrictions
by
leaving
their
drinks
at
full-price
and
discounting
their
food
instead
.
<EOS>
A
guest
can
beat
the
system
by
simply
patronizing
a
bar
that
offers
inexpensive
drinks
during
all
of
its
hours
of
operations
.
<EOS>
We
should
instead
be
addressing
this
issue
at
the
core
with
responsible
service
.
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
happy
hour
bans
,
I
'd
like
to
see
legislature
that
requires
all
food
and
beverage
establishments
to
annually
certify
all
employees
who
serve
alcohol
through
an
accredited
alcohol
management
program
.
<EOS>
New
hires
should
be
put
through
the
program
before
they
start
.
<EOS>
I
've
participated
in
a
number
of
such
certifications
,
and
I
require
that
my
entire
staff
be
certified
.
<EOS>
Every
establishment
has
an
obligation
to
ensure
the
safety
of
its
guests
at
all
times
--
not
solely
during
happy
hour
.
