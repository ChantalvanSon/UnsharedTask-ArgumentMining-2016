COMMENT:
I
think
women
who
use
these
devices
should
get
an
additional
government
stipend.
I
would
be
glad
to
contribute.
Unwanted
pregnancy
has
harmed
so
many
lives.
I
can't
believe
there's
argument
about
this:
let's
make
contraception
available,
affordable,
desirable.
And
let's
stop
talking
as
if
contraception
affects
only
women.
Many
men
have
had
their
lives
blasted
by
unwanted
pregnancies.
<EOS>
Publicly
Funded
Birth
Control
Is
Crucial
.
<EOS>
All
women
should
have
the
means
to
make
fundamental
choices
about
whether
and
when
to
have
children
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
the
public
investment
in
family
planning
that
enables
young
and
low-income
women
to
plan
their
own
pregnancies
is
smart
government
at
its
best
.
<EOS>
It
leads
to
healthier
mothers
and
babies
,
empowers
women
to
finish
their
education
or
job
training
,
and
saves
billions
in
taxpayer
dollars
.
<EOS>
Having
access
to
the
full
range
of
contraceptive
methods
,
including
highly
effective
long-acting
methods
,
and
the
information
needed
to
choose
the
method
that
best
fits
a
woman
's
life
is
key
to
achieving
planned
,
healthier
pregnancies
.
<EOS>
But
cost
can
be
a
significant
barrier
for
many
women
to
obtain
the
birth
control
method
of
her
choice
.
<EOS>
That
's
why
federal
and
state
investments
in
publicly
supported
family
planning
services
are
so
crucial
.
<EOS>
The
enormous
benefit
of
these
investments
is
well
documented
:
Guttmacher
Institute
research
shows
that
in
2010
,
publicly
funded
family
planning
services
helped
women
to
avoid
2.2
million
unintended
pregnancies
.
<EOS>
These
unintended
pregnancies
,
in
turn
,
would
have
resulted
in
1.1
million
unintended
births
and
760,000
abortions
.
<EOS>
Further
,
while
publicly
supported
family
planning
services
enable
low-income
women
to
have
healthier
pregnancies
and
achieve
their
life
goals
,
they
also
yield
considerable
dividends
for
taxpayers
.
<EOS>
In
2010
,
these
services
resulted
in
a
net
savings
to
the
federal
and
state
governments
of
$
13.6
billion
-
$
7
for
every
public
dollar
spent
.
<EOS>
About
half
of
these
impressive
gains
come
from
family
planning
centers
supported
by
the
Title
X
national
family
planning
program
,
the
linchpin
of
the
U.
S.
family
planning
effort
.
<EOS>
Without
the
services
provided
by
these
centers
in
2012
,
the
number
of
unintended
pregnancies
and
abortions
in
the
United
States
would
be
32
percent
higher
.
<EOS>
Healthier
pregnancies
,
a
steep
reduction
in
need
for
abortion
and
significant
fiscal
savings
-
policymakers
of
all
stripes
should
line
up
to
support
such
a
hugely
successful
program
,
and
for
decades
they
had
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
social
conservatives
in
the
U.S
.
<EOS>
Congress
are
putting
ideology
over
evidence
,
with
the
House
voting
to
eliminate
Title
X
entirely
and
the
Senate
proposing
deep
cuts
to
the
program
.
<EOS>
Doing
so
is
deeply
irresponsible
and
,
ultimately
,
self-defeating
.
<EOS>
Policy
makers
should
instead
respect
Americans
'
wishes
by
protecting
contraceptive
access
.
<EOS>
That
means
adequately
funding
Title
X
and
implementing
the
Affordable
Care
Act
's
Medicaid
expansion
in
all
states
.
<EOS>
Policymakers
should
not
erect
new
barriers
that
raise
the
cost
of
birth
control
or
otherwise
interfere
with
a
woman
's
ability
to
use
the
contraceptive
method
that
is
right
for
her
.
<EOS>
Tens
of
millions
of
people
in
the
United
States
rely
on
contraception
to
achieve
their
childbearing
goals
.
<EOS>
Let
's
make
sure
the
ability
to
prevent
unwanted
pregnancies
and
space
wanted
ones
is
available
to
all
who
want
it
,
regardless
of
their
income
.
<EOS>
