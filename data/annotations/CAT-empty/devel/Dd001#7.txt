COMMENT:
I'm
a
women's
college
alum
now
pursuing
my
PhD
in
a
quantitative
field
at
a
top
co-ed
institution.
How
on
earth
does
that
undermine
the
benefit
I
received
from
a
single-sex
undergraduate
education?
Graduate
and
undergraduate
degrees
are
very,
very
different
things.
Undergraduates
are
"finding
themselves,"
making
broad
explorations
of
the
world,
grappling
with
big
questions
that
they
still
think
they
might
be
able
to
answer.
As
an
undergraduate,
one's
sense
of
self
and
sense
of
the
world
is
incredibly
mutable--and
thus
easily
influenced
by
external
forces
and
expectations,
many
of
which
are
implicit.
Undergrads
are
much
more
strongly
shaped
by
their
environment
than
grad
students.
As
a
grad
student,
yes,
culture
matters,
and
I
am
influenced
by
my
academic
environment.
But
being
more
mature,
I'm
conscious
of
those
influences,
and
thus
better
able
to
protect
myself
from
those
that
are
harmful.
The
institution
doesn't
play
the
same
kind
of
formative
role
for
graduate
students,
so
you
really
can't
compare
them.
In
my
graduate
program,
women
are
underrepresented:
about
30%
of
my
graduate
program
is
female,
and
less
than
10%
of
our
faculty--and
these
ratios
are
entirely
normal
for
my
discipline.
At
this
point
in
my
development,
I
can
survive
and
even
prosper
in
that
setting.
But
I
never
would
have
had
the
confidence
to
take
the
math
classes
that
allowed
me
to
get
where
I
am
today
if
I'd
gone
to
a
co-ed
school.
Should
lack
of
confidence
at
18
or
19
limit
career
options?

Sweet
Briar
Is
Fighting
an
Up-Hill
Battle
.
<EOS>
Despite
a
beautiful
campus
,
dedicated
faculty
,
loyal
alumnae
and
a
significant
endowment
,
Sweet
Briar
College
is
closing
after
114
years
.
<EOS>
Too
few
students
were
choosing
Sweet
Briar
,
so
the
college
discounted
its
tuition
rate
,
a
move
that
exacerbated
its
financial
problems
but
did
not
succeed
in
attracting
enough
students
.
<EOS>
As
a
small
,
rural
,
liberal
arts
women
's
college
,
Sweet
Briar
was
fighting
an
up-hill
battle
against
many
trends
in
higher
education
.
<EOS>
Although
all
of
these
variables
probably
contributed
to
the
lack
of
student
interest
,
President
James
Jones
,
Jr.
acknowledged
that
declining
interest
in
single-sex
education
was
decisive
in
its
demise
.
<EOS>
Data
supports
this
conclusion
:
According
to
the
Women
's
College
Coalition
,
the
number
of
women
's
colleges
declined
from
230
to
little
more
than
40
in
the
last
half-century
.
<EOS>
By
many
measures
,
today
's
women
are
flourishing
in
higher
education
and
do
not
need
a
protected
environment
to
develop
their
intellectual
potential
.
<EOS>
Women
are
enrolled
in
higher
education
at
higher
rates
than
men
and
achieve
better
grades
.
<EOS>
Young
women
are
at
or
near
parity
in
many
``
traditionally
male
''
professions
including
law
and
medicine
.
<EOS>
While
women
are
still
underrepresented
in
positions
of
leadership
and
in
some
,
but
not
all
,
math-intensive
disciplines
,
there
is
no
data
to
support
the
myth
that
single-sex
colleges
prepare
women
better
to
become
leaders
in
our
co-ed
world
or
that
their
graduates
are
more
likely
to
choose
math-intensive
career
options
.
<EOS>
The
popular
idea
that
single-sex
education
benefits
women
comes
from
anecdotes
about
female
leaders
who
were
educated
in
an
era
when
elite
colleges
did
not
admit
them
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
Hillary
Clinton
attended
Wellesley
College
,
but
she
also
graduated
from
Yale
Law
School
,
which
was
co-ed
.
