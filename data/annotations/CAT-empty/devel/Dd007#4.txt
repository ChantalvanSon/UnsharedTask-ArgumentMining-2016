COMMENT:
It
is
a
shame
when
a
psychology
professor
is
not
up
to
speed
on
the
latest
research.
The
data
is
now
in:
cell
phone
notifications,
even
when
not
responded
to,
distract
young
people
from
whatever
task
they
are
doing
and
make
them
do
it
less
well
than
if
they
were
not
distracted.
Here's
the
journal
article
abstract:
The
Attentional
Cost
of
Receiving
a
Cell
Phone
Notification.

Abstract
It
is
well
documented
that
interacting
with
a
mobile
phone
is
associated
with
poorer
performance
on
concurrently
performed
tasks
because
limited
attentional
resources
must
be
shared
between
tasks.
However,
mobile
phones
generate
auditory
or
tactile
notifications
to
alert
users
of
incoming
calls
and
messages.
Although
these
notifications
are
generally
short
in
duration,
they
can
prompt
task-irrelevant
thoughts,
or
mind
wandering,
which
has
been
shown
to
damage
task
performance.
We
found
that
cellular
phone
notifications
alone
significantly
disrupted
performance
on
an
attention-demanding
task,
even
when
participants
did
not
directly
interact
with
a
mobile
device
during
the
task.
The
magnitude
of
observed
distraction
effects
was
comparable
in
magnitude
to
those
seen
when
users
actively
used
a
mobile
phone,
either
for
voice
calls
or
text
messaging.

Cyberbullying
Is
a
Bigger
Problem
Than
Screen
Time
Addiction
.
<EOS>
The
harms
that
can
come
to
children
who
use
technology
excessively
-
including
depression
,
behavioral
problems
and
poor
academic
performance
-
are
not
just
caused
by
too
much
screen
time
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
nature
of
the
interactions
that
take
place
through
the
screen
that
count
.
<EOS>
Simply
limiting
screen
time
ignores
the
many
benefits
of
technology
for
teenagers
.
<EOS>
But
cybervictimization
is
a
problem
that
's
become
pervasive
.
<EOS>
The
bullies
have
moved
from
the
playground
to
the
mobile
screen
,
and
there
is
no
escaping
harassment
that
essentially
lives
in
your
pocket
.
<EOS>
Bullying
and
online
harassment
increases
anxiety
and
depression
,
and
it
often
compounds
mental
health
problems
over
multiple
years
.
<EOS>
In
particular
,
race-related
online
victimization
-
including
the
circulation
of
racist
imagery
-
is
on
the
rise
,
with
50
percent
of
adolescents
of
color
reporting
these
incidents
in
2013
,
up
from
32
percent
in
2011
,
according
to
my
own
research
.
<EOS>
These
incidents
are
associated
with
poor
mental
health
and
well-being
,
as
well
as
decreased
academic
motivation
and
behavioral
problems
.
<EOS>
But
scholars
are
beginning
to
make
distinctions
between
screen
time
that
interferes
with
functioning
,
and
that
which
leads
to
more
positive
engagement
.
<EOS>
With
respect
to
problematic
video
game
playing
,
for
example
,
those
who
might
be
considered
``
addicted
''
include
only
about
3
to
5
percent
of
adolescents
.
<EOS>
By
contrast
,
video
game
playing
,
regardless
of
type
,
has
also
been
linked
to
creativity
in
middle
school
students
.
<EOS>
We
don'
t
yet
know
how
much
screen
time
for
positive
uses
,
such
as
content
creation
,
is
too
much
.
<EOS>
But
certain
examples
of
good
works
-
like
that
of
six
middle
school
girls
who
spent
hours
buried
in
code
,
and
created
an
app
to
help
their
blind
classmate
get
around
campus
-
remind
us
of
the
good
that
children
and
teenagers
can
do
with
their
screen
time
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
we
wouldn'
t
want
them
to
forsake
their
schoolwork
or
personal
relationships
,
but
would
we
call
that
kind
of
drive
and
focus
an
``
addiction
''
?
