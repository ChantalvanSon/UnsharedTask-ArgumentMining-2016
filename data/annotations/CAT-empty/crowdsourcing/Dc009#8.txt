COMMENT:
I
am
against
declawing.
We
recently
bought
a
leather
sofa
and
my
wife
and
I
had
argued
at
the
store
if
the
cat
could
be
trained
not
to
scratch
it
to
pieces,
and
my
wife
was
right,
the
cat
went
crazy
with
a
big
scratch
fest.
Luckily
we
had
3
days
to
decide
if
we
wanted
to
keep
the
couch
and
we
had
decided
not
to
fully
unwrap
it,
so
we
called
and
asked
them
to
trade
it
for
a
Lazy
Boy
and
kitchen
table
and
chairs.
In
the
end
it
was
easier
to
modify
our
behavior
and
not
bring
something
as
irresistible
as
leather
into
the
house
knowing
we
have
a
scratch
happy
kitty.

Declawing
a
Pet
Should
Be
Illegal
,
Period
.
<EOS>
Declawing
is
not
some
sort
of
specialized
manicure
that
only
a
vet
can
do
,
it
is
amputation
of
the
toe
bones
that
contain
the
claws
.
<EOS>
Legislation
prohibiting
this
surgery
is
necessary
to
protect
cats
from
this
often
debilitating
procedure
.
<EOS>
The
United
States
veterinary
profession
has
rationalized
breaking
its
oath
to
``
do
no
harm
''
when
it
comes
to
declawing
.
<EOS>
Vets
will
say
that
by
declawing
a
cat
,
they
are
ensuring
a
cat
a
home
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
how
they
can
say
that
.
<EOS>
If
an
owner
is
so
intolerant
of
a
cat
scratching
furniture
,
that
same
owner
is
not
likely
to
be
tolerant
when
his
declawed
cat
stops
using
the
litter
box
because
the
sand
hurts
its
amputated
toe
nubs
,
or
when
that
cat
starts
biting
to
protect
itself
because
it
has
no
claws
.
<EOS>
Both
of
these
behavior
problems
have
been
noticed
in
cats
after
declawing
.
<EOS>
Vets
also
offer
another
unfounded
excuse
that
they
only
declaw
cats
to
protect
immuno-compromised
humans
.
<EOS>
But
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
says
that
declawing
the
cats
of
people
living
with
immuno-compromised
individuals
is
``
not
advised
.
''
<EOS>
In
many
countries
,
declawing
is
illegal
or
considered
unethical
by
veterinary
professionals
,
and
there
,
immuno-compromised
people
are
able
to
cope
with
cat
claws
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
declawed
cats
,
especially
those
in
pain
,
are
likely
to
bite
harder
and
more
often
than
their
clawed
counterparts
.
<EOS>
Bite
wounds
are
almost
always
far
more
serious
than
scratches
.
<EOS>
Although
some
veterinarians
offer
discount
coupons
for
declawing
and
most
recommend
only
declawing
kittens
or
cats
under
two
years
,
many
vets
will
claim
that
they
declaw
as
a
``
last
resort
,
''
after
all
humane
options
have
failed
.
<EOS>
They
will
say
that
they
try
to
talk
everyone
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
that
is
true
,
why
does
the
New
York
State
Veterinary
Medical
Society
oppose
this
bill
?
<EOS>
Isn'
t
the
ultimate
way
to
talk
people
out
of
declawing
simply
to
say
it
is
illegal
?
