COMMENT:
Make
it
illegal.
I
raised
3
beautiful
strays,
none
of
which
were
declawed.
My
cats
are
all
well
cared
for,
loved,
and
yea,
from
time
to
time
I
wake
up
to
the
sound
of
claws
on
my
couch.
I
will
say
I
spoil
my
cats,
not
horribly,
but
they
have
toys,
scratch
post,
etc.
No
pet
(fur
baby)
is
perfect.
So
because
they
claw
your
couch
you
rip
their
fingers
out?
Sooooo,
please
don't
procreate
I
don't
want
to
know
what
you
would
do
to
a
human
child
for
say
wetting
the
bed,
or
throwing
a
temper.....pets
have
feelings,
brains,
hearts,
etc.
Treat
them
with
some
respect
and
understanding.
Ask
yourself
"what
can
I
do
differently
to
help
my
cats
bad
behavior."
I'll
also
add
my
cats
are
loving
and
have
NEVER
bitten
anyone!
They
also
don't
scratch
or
claw
me,
in
fact
2
out
of
3
are
especially
aware
of
people
are
are
careful
to
retract
claws
when
playing/running/jumping
near
humans.
Time
and
patience.
Stop
being
lazy
and
cruel.

Declawing
a
Pet
Should
Be
Illegal
,
Period
.
<EOS>
Declawing
is
not
some
sort
of
specialized
manicure
that
only
a
vet
can
do
,
it
is
amputation
of
the
toe
bones
that
contain
the
claws
.
<EOS>
Legislation
prohibiting
this
surgery
is
necessary
to
protect
cats
from
this
often
debilitating
procedure
.
<EOS>
The
United
States
veterinary
profession
has
rationalized
breaking
its
oath
to
``
do
no
harm
''
when
it
comes
to
declawing
.
<EOS>
Vets
will
say
that
by
declawing
a
cat
,
they
are
ensuring
a
cat
a
home
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
how
they
can
say
that
.
<EOS>
If
an
owner
is
so
intolerant
of
a
cat
scratching
furniture
,
that
same
owner
is
not
likely
to
be
tolerant
when
his
declawed
cat
stops
using
the
litter
box
because
the
sand
hurts
its
amputated
toe
nubs
,
or
when
that
cat
starts
biting
to
protect
itself
because
it
has
no
claws
.
<EOS>
Both
of
these
behavior
problems
have
been
noticed
in
cats
after
declawing
.
<EOS>
Vets
also
offer
another
unfounded
excuse
that
they
only
declaw
cats
to
protect
immuno-compromised
humans
.
<EOS>
But
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
says
that
declawing
the
cats
of
people
living
with
immuno-compromised
individuals
is
``
not
advised
.
''
<EOS>
In
many
countries
,
declawing
is
illegal
or
considered
unethical
by
veterinary
professionals
,
and
there
,
immuno-compromised
people
are
able
to
cope
with
cat
claws
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
declawed
cats
,
especially
those
in
pain
,
are
likely
to
bite
harder
and
more
often
than
their
clawed
counterparts
.
<EOS>
Bite
wounds
are
almost
always
far
more
serious
than
scratches
.
<EOS>
Although
some
veterinarians
offer
discount
coupons
for
declawing
and
most
recommend
only
declawing
kittens
or
cats
under
two
years
,
many
vets
will
claim
that
they
declaw
as
a
``
last
resort
,
''
after
all
humane
options
have
failed
.
<EOS>
They
will
say
that
they
try
to
talk
everyone
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
that
is
true
,
why
does
the
New
York
State
Veterinary
Medical
Society
oppose
this
bill
?
<EOS>
Isn'
t
the
ultimate
way
to
talk
people
out
of
declawing
simply
to
say
it
is
illegal
?
<EOS>
