COMMENT:
Is
this
relevancy
conversation
about
Sweet
Briar
College,
or
about
same-sex
colleges
in
general?
There
are
quite
a
few
same-sex
colleges
that
are
booming
with
interested
applicants
each
year:
Barnard,
Smith,
Mount
Holyoke,
and
even
Wellesley.
So
come
on,
we
can't
use
one
college
as
an
omen
for
the
others.
The
real
question
is
why
-
why
did
women
students
stop
applying
to
Sweet
Briar
specifically?
Let's
speak
about
that.
<EOS>
Sweet
Briar
Is
Fighting
an
Up-Hill
Battle
.
<EOS>
Despite
a
beautiful
campus
,
dedicated
faculty
,
loyal
alumnae
and
a
significant
endowment
,
Sweet
Briar
College
is
closing
after
114
years
.
<EOS>
Too
few
students
were
choosing
Sweet
Briar
,
so
the
college
discounted
its
tuition
rate
,
a
move
that
exacerbated
its
financial
problems
but
did
not
succeed
in
attracting
enough
students
.
<EOS>
As
a
small
,
rural
,
liberal
arts
women
's
college
,
Sweet
Briar
was
fighting
an
up-hill
battle
against
many
trends
in
higher
education
.
<EOS>
Although
all
of
these
variables
probably
contributed
to
the
lack
of
student
interest
,
President
James
Jones
,
Jr.
acknowledged
that
declining
interest
in
single-sex
education
was
decisive
in
its
demise
.
<EOS>
Data
supports
this
conclusion
:
According
to
the
Women
's
College
Coalition
,
the
number
of
women
's
colleges
declined
from
230
to
little
more
than
40
in
the
last
half-century
.
<EOS>
By
many
measures
,
today
's
women
are
flourishing
in
higher
education
and
do
not
need
a
protected
environment
to
develop
their
intellectual
potential
.
<EOS>
Women
are
enrolled
in
higher
education
at
higher
rates
than
men
and
achieve
better
grades
.
<EOS>
Young
women
are
at
or
near
parity
in
many
``
traditionally
male
''
professions
including
law
and
medicine
.
<EOS>
While
women
are
still
underrepresented
in
positions
of
leadership
and
in
some
,
but
not
all
,
math-intensive
disciplines
,
there
is
no
data
to
support
the
myth
that
single-sex
colleges
prepare
women
better
to
become
leaders
in
our
co-ed
world
or
that
their
graduates
are
more
likely
to
choose
math-intensive
career
options
.
<EOS>
The
popular
idea
that
single-sex
education
benefits
women
comes
from
anecdotes
about
female
leaders
who
were
educated
in
an
era
when
elite
colleges
did
not
admit
them
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
Hillary
Clinton
attended
Wellesley
College
,
but
she
also
graduated
from
Yale
Law
School
,
which
was
co-ed
.
