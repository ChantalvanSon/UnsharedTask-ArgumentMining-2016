COMMENT:
And
yet
not
a
single
writer
in
this
series
notes
a
fundamental
irony:
Despite
the
declining
number
of
young
men
and
women
who
express
interest
in
attending
a
single-sex
college,
thousands
of
these
same
women
and
men
every
year
enter
co-educational
institutions,
then
immediately
set
about
segregating
themselves:
from
men-
and
women-only
dorms
to
sports
teams
to
fraternities
and
sororities.
Let's
not
fool
ourselves.
The
experience
of
higher
education
in
this
country
is
profoundly
gendered,
no
matter
how
much
some
of
these
contributors
would
like
us
to
believe
otherwise.

The
Freeing
Powers
of
Single-Sex
Education
.
<EOS>
Years
ago
,
during
a
classroom
visit
,
I
observed
a
small
group
of
black
and
Latino
high
school
boys
sitting
at
their
desks
looking
into
handheld
mirrors
.
<EOS>
They
were
tasked
with
answering
the
question
,
``
What
do
you
see
?
''
<EOS>
One
boy
said
,
``
I
see
an
ugly
face
.
''
<EOS>
Another
said
,
``
I
see
a
big
nose
.
''
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
many
moments
I
observed
in
single-sex
schools
where
black
and
Latino
boys
felt
comfortable
,
and
allowed
,
to
express
their
emotions
,
changing
notions
about
a
one
dimensional
image
of
masculinity
.
<EOS>
Our
society
is
partly
responsible
for
the
ways
in
which
gender-based
expectations
can
be
reinforced
and
,
over
time
,
those
expectations
can
help
create
vulnerable
situations
that
lead
to
limited
economic
mobility
,
job
opportunity
and
leadership
development
.
<EOS>
A
benefit
of
single-sex
environments
is
the
opportunity
for
cognitive
expansion
that
can
exist
alongside
multifaceted
displays
of
masculinity
and
femininity
.
<EOS>
In
single-sex
education
,
teachers
make
an
understanding
of
race
,
ethnicity
,
linguistic
diversity
,
masculinity
,
femininity
and
sexuality
a
profound
part
of
their
educational
mission
.
<EOS>
Such
identity-driven
missions
create
protective
environments
,
like
the
ones
found
in
single-sex
high
schools
like
Urban
Prep
Academy
and
Eagle
Academy
,
and
colleges
like
Bryn
Mawr
,
Spelman
and
Morehouse
.
<EOS>
Overall
,
the
closing
of
single-sex
colleges
like
Sweet
Briar
may
be
more
indicative
of
economic
and
demographic
dynamics
-
stagnant
high
school
graduation
and
college
readiness
,
increasing
college
costs
and
the
rise
in
online
education
-
rather
than
a
drop
in
importance
and
relevance
for
environments
where
``
Who
I
am
''
and
``
Who
I
want
to
be
''
take
center
stage
.
<EOS>
Those
questions
,
safely
explored
,
allow
students
to
develop
in
healthy
cognitive
,
social
and
emotional
ways
,
with
gender
nonconforming
values
.
