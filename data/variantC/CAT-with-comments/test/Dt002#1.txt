COMMENT:
What
she
left
out:
Every
American
military
person
stationed
on
the
island
pays
their
federal
income
taxes
to
the
US
government,
which
immediately
turns
it
over
to
the
government
of
Guam.
Guam
elects
its
own
Governor
and
Senators,
and
they
are
restricted
in
their
legislation
only
by
the
US
Constitution
and
by
their
own
definition
of
its
restrictions.
The
stall
in
letting
Guam
become
its
own
Republic
or
a
State
of
the
Union
is
because,
since
1971,
when
the
first
Guamanian
Governor
was
elected,
every
one
has
been
hauled
into
a
Federal
court
for
one
felony
or
another,
mostly
screwing
over
their
fellow
Guamanians.
I'm
glad
she
brought
up
the
limited
status
Guamanians
have,
as
it
would
be
a
good
compromise
to
kicking
out
every
illegal
and
their
descendents
who
are
here
due
to
an
anchor
baby....with
one
exception....NEVER
allowed
to
vote.
EVER.
If
that
sounds
harsh,
realize
we
became
the
magnet
due
to
our
culture
and
work
ethic
as
much
as
the
rule
of
law
we
established.
Not
one
American
can
get
the
benefits
now
shoveled
toward
illegals
by
liberal
vote
buyers.
Legitimizing
them
will
put
an
end
to
our
society,
and
then
we
can't
even
export
the
help
we
could
otherwise
provide.
We
cannot
absorb
all
those
who
live
in
poverty
in
this
world.
We
CAN
help
them
make
their
own
country
a
place
worth
staying
in.
Those
wanting
illegals
to
have
a
pass
on
their
federal
crime
of
illegal
entry
are
asking
to
kill
the
golden
goose.

The
Insular
Cases
Are
a
Cautionary
Tale
in
the
Citizenship
Debate
.
<EOS>
The
conventional
understanding
of
the
citizenship
clause
,
as
highlighted
by
recent
calls
to
abolish
birthright
citizenship
in
the
United
States
,
presumes
that
all
persons
born
on
United
States
soil
obtain
citizenship
at
birth
.
<EOS>
This
understanding
is
incomplete
.
<EOS>
Unbeknownst
to
many
,
there
is
another
category
that
,
like
citizenship
,
is
also
acquired
at
birth
:
the
noncitizen
national
.
<EOS>
Established
through
Congress
's
absolute
power
over
the
territories
,
noncitizen
national
status
was
accorded
to
people
born
in
the
islands
acquired
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century
,
including
the
Philippines
,
Puerto
Rico
,
Guam
and
American
Samoa
.
<EOS>
Far
from
a
historical
relic
,
noncitizen
national
status
remains
the
status
of
those
who
are
born
in
American
Samoa
today
,
although
its
constitutionality
is
being
challenged.
(
Congress
conferred
citizenship
to
Puerto
Ricans
in
1917
and
Guamanians
in
1950
,
and
it
took
away
the
national
status
of
Filipinos
residing
in
the
United
States
when
the
Philippines
ceased
being
a
U.
S.
territory
in
1946.
)
<EOS>
Why
bring
up
noncitizen
nationals
in
a
discussion
about
whether
to
abolish
birthright
citizenship
?
<EOS>
The
resurgence
of
a
proposal
to
do
away
with
birthright
citizenship
fails
to
address
the
political
and
racial
caste
system
that
it
would
create
,
and
which
the
framers
of
the
14th
Amendment
sought
to
eliminate
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
as
the
forgotten
story
of
noncitizen
nationals
shows
,
such
a
hierarchy
already
exists
under
U.
S.
jurisdiction
.
<EOS>
Although
born
on
U.
S.
soil
,
noncitizen
nationals
have
an
inferior
status
compared
to
citizens
.
<EOS>
On
the
one
hand
,
they
are
treated
like
citizens
;
for
instance
,
they
have
right
to
enter
and
reside
in
the
United
States
indefinitely
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
they
are
treated
as
if
they
are
noncitizens
:
They
do
not
have
the
right
to
vote
,
serve
on
juries
,
bear
arms
and
apply
for
federal
and
certain
state
jobs
.
<EOS>
The
origin
of
this
secondary
status
may
be
traced
to
a
line
of
early
20th
century
Supreme
Court
cases
known
as
the
Insular
Cases
.
<EOS>
In
these
cases
,
the
Supreme
Court
held
that
only
fundamental
rights
apply
in
the
U.
S.
territories
because
it
would
be
difficult
to
assimilate
these
``
alien
races
''
through
``
Anglo-Saxon
principles
.
''
<EOS>
Despite
the
racism
,
the
Insular
Cases
continue
to
be
good
law
.
<EOS>
Notably
,
relying
on
these
cases
,
courts
have
held
that
the
citizenship
clause
does
not
extend
to
the
territories
.
<EOS>
The
Insular
Cases
ensured
that
the
question
of
citizenship
in
the
U.
S.
territories
is
viewed
as
distinct
from
the
issue
of
citizenship
at
birth
in
one
of
the
50
states
.
<EOS>
The
caste
system
that
existed
for
decades
and
continues
to
this
day
because
of
the
failure
to
extend
the
citizenship
clause
to
the
U.
S.
territories
should
serve
as
cautionary
tale
.
<EOS>
Doing
away
with
birthright
citizenship
will
create
an
even
larger
population
of
second-class
members
in
the
American
polity
.
