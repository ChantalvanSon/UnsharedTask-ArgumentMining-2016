COMMENT:
The
full
language
of
the
"birthright
citizenship"
clause
of
the
Fourteenth
Amendment
actually
requires
three
things:
1.
Birth
in
the
U.S.
2.
Subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
US
for
all
purposes,
like
taxation,
subject
to
draft
into
the
military,
etc.,
and
3.
Actual
residency
in
a
State
of
the
US.
Children
born
of
"birth
tourist"
parents
do
not
reside
in
the
US,
and
are
not
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
for
all
purposes.
One
cannot
simply
ignore
the
residency
requirement,
which
obviously
implies
LEGAL
residency.
We
don't
need
a
Constitutional
amendment,
just
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
entire
sentence
of
the
Fourteenth.
<EOS>
Birthright
Citizenship
Is
Not
Actually
in
the
Constitution
.
<EOS>
The
question
of
whether
birthright
citizenship
should
be
abolished
is
based
on
the
faulty
premise
that
our
Constitution
actually
mandates
it
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
text
of
the
14th
Amendment
's
citizenship
clause
reads
:
``
All
persons
born
or
naturalized
in
the
United
States
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof
,
are
citizens
of
the
United
States
and
of
the
State
wherein
they
reside
.
''
<EOS>
That
text
has
two
requirements
for
citizenship
-
that
an
individual
is
born
on
U.
S.
soil
;
and
that
an
individual
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
United
States
when
born
.
<EOS>
``
Subject
to
the
jurisdiction
''
means
more
than
simply
being
present
in
the
United
States
.
<EOS>
When
the
14th
Amendment
was
being
debated
in
the
Senate
,
Senator
Lyman
Trumbull
,
a
key
figure
in
its
drafting
and
adoption
,
stated
that
``
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
''
of
the
United
States
meant
not
``
owing
allegiance
to
anybody
else
.
''
<EOS>
And
Senator
Jacob
Howard
,
who
introduced
the
language
of
the
clause
on
the
floor
of
the
Senate
,
contended
that
it
should
be
interpreted
in
the
same
way
as
the
requirement
of
the
1866
Civil
Rights
Act
,
which
afforded
citizenship
to
``
all
persons
born
in
the
United
States
and
not
subject
to
any
foreign
power
.
''
<EOS>
The
Supreme
Court
has
never
held
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Some
advocates
for
illegal
immigrants
point
to
the
1898
case
of
United
States
v.
Wong
Kim
Ark
,
but
that
case
merely
held
that
a
child
born
on
U.
S.
soil
to
parents
who
were
lawful
,
permanent
(
legally
,
``
domiciled
''
)
residents
was
a
citizen
.
<EOS>
The
broader
language
in
the
case
suggesting
that
birth
on
U.
S.
soil
is
alone
sufficient
(
thereby
rendering
the
``
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
''
clause
meaningless
)
is
only
dicta
-
not
binding
.
<EOS>
The
court
did
not
specifically
consider
whether
those
born
to
parents
who
were
in
the
United
States
unlawfully
were
automatically
citizens
.
<EOS>
The
misunderstood
policy
of
birthright
citizenship
provides
a
powerful
magnet
for
people
to
violate
our
immigration
laws
and
undermines
the
plenary
power
over
naturalization
that
the
Constitution
explicitly
gives
to
Congress
.
<EOS>
It
is
long
past
time
to
clarify
that
the
14th
Amendment
does
not
grant
U.
S.
citizenship
to
the
children
of
anyone
just
because
they
can
manage
to
give
birth
on
U.
S.
soil
.
