COMMENT:
Slavery
was
a
state
of
being
owned
by
another
person
and
having
not
many
legal
rights
greater
than
any
other
living
thing
owned,
so
when
slavery
ended
the
law
had
to
find
a
way
to
recognize
the
legal
standing
and
rights
of
former
slaves.
Did
they
have
a
right
to
stay
in
the
country
as
citizens
or
not?
None
had
any
legal
documents
proving
that
they
were
citizens.
Going
through
some
kind
of
legal
registering
of
all
those
people
to
provide
them
with
proof
of
citizenship
like
was
impossible.
The
only
rational
solution
was
to
stipulate
that
if
they
were
born
in
the
U.S.
they
were
citizens.
Similar
problems
occurred
with
the
waves
of
immigrants
and
their
children
for
many
generations
from
the
beginning
of
the
United
States
through
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century.
Children
who
grew
up
in
the
United
States
whether
born
here
or
not
were
self
identified
Americans
who
would
never
belong
in
the
countries
from
which
their
parent
came.
It
just
made
sense
to
make
citizenship
legal
if
the
children
were
born
here,
and
it
still
does.
The
undocumented
people
came
to
and
stay
in
this
country
to
work,
live
and
to
enjoy
prosperous
lives,
they
are
not
some
invasion
force
seeking
to
replace
the
U.S.
with
some
new
country.

Birthright
Citizenship
Is
Not
Actually
in
the
Constitution
.
<EOS>
The
question
of
whether
birthright
citizenship
should
be
abolished
is
based
on
the
faulty
premise
that
our
Constitution
actually
mandates
it
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
text
of
the
14th
Amendment
's
citizenship
clause
reads
:
``
All
persons
born
or
naturalized
in
the
United
States
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof
,
are
citizens
of
the
United
States
and
of
the
State
wherein
they
reside
.
''
<EOS>
That
text
has
two
requirements
for
citizenship
-
that
an
individual
is
born
on
U.
S.
soil
;
and
that
an
individual
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
United
States
when
born
.
<EOS>
``
Subject
to
the
jurisdiction
''
means
more
than
simply
being
present
in
the
United
States
.
<EOS>
When
the
14th
Amendment
was
being
debated
in
the
Senate
,
Senator
Lyman
Trumbull
,
a
key
figure
in
its
drafting
and
adoption
,
stated
that
``
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
''
of
the
United
States
meant
not
``
owing
allegiance
to
anybody
else
.
''
<EOS>
And
Senator
Jacob
Howard
,
who
introduced
the
language
of
the
clause
on
the
floor
of
the
Senate
,
contended
that
it
should
be
interpreted
in
the
same
way
as
the
requirement
of
the
1866
Civil
Rights
Act
,
which
afforded
citizenship
to
``
all
persons
born
in
the
United
States
and
not
subject
to
any
foreign
power
.
''
<EOS>
The
Supreme
Court
has
never
held
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Some
advocates
for
illegal
immigrants
point
to
the
1898
case
of
United
States
v.
Wong
Kim
Ark
,
but
that
case
merely
held
that
a
child
born
on
U.
S.
soil
to
parents
who
were
lawful
,
permanent
(
legally
,
``
domiciled
''
)
residents
was
a
citizen
.
<EOS>
The
broader
language
in
the
case
suggesting
that
birth
on
U.
S.
soil
is
alone
sufficient
(
thereby
rendering
the
``
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
''
clause
meaningless
)
is
only
dicta
-
not
binding
.
<EOS>
The
court
did
not
specifically
consider
whether
those
born
to
parents
who
were
in
the
United
States
unlawfully
were
automatically
citizens
.
<EOS>
The
misunderstood
policy
of
birthright
citizenship
provides
a
powerful
magnet
for
people
to
violate
our
immigration
laws
and
undermines
the
plenary
power
over
naturalization
that
the
Constitution
explicitly
gives
to
Congress
.
<EOS>
It
is
long
past
time
to
clarify
that
the
14th
Amendment
does
not
grant
U.
S.
citizenship
to
the
children
of
anyone
just
because
they
can
manage
to
give
birth
on
U.
S.
soil
.
