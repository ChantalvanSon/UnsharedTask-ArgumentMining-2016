COMMENT:
I
have
lost
family
due
to
addiction.
I
have
seen
others
handle
the
addiction
of
their
family
member
both
ways
by
'being
there
for
them'
and
by
'involuntary
commitment.'
The
one
thing
that
seems
to
run
true
through
all
of
this,
is
that
the
change
must
come
from
within
the
addicted
person.
Until
that
happens
you
are
wasting
your
time,
because
you
must
eventually
leave
that
person
to
themselves,
and
if
THEY
have
not
changed
they
will
relapse.
In
addition,
there
is
a
fundamental
moral
issue
here.
Each
person
must
be
free
to
walk
their
own
path,
even,
perhaps
especially,
if
it
is
a
path
we
would
not
choose.
It
is
their
choice
and
their
consequences.

Compelled
Drug
Addiction
Treatment
Works
Because
of
Retention
.
<EOS>
There
is
little
question
that
civil
commitment
saves
lives
of
severely
addicted
people
in
the
short
term
by
abruptly
interrupting
cycles
of
extreme
self-destruction
.
<EOS>
This
acute
rescue
function
is
not
enough
,
however
.
<EOS>
While
everyone
prefers
that
patients
voluntarily
get
help
instead
of
being
forced
into
it
,
the
rate
of
drop-out
from
voluntary
commitment
after
several
weeks
is
a
common
problem
.
<EOS>
Drop
out
almost
always
means
relapse
.
<EOS>
Civil
commitment
-
with
patients
'
legal
right
to
challenge
,
of
course
-
provides
the
leverage
to
remain
in
care
.
<EOS>
But
can
treatment
work
if
it
is
compelled
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
There
is
ample
evidence
that
it
is
at
least
as
effective
,
and
sometimes
more
effective
,
than
voluntary
care
.
<EOS>
Again
,
the
reason
is
retention
:
The
longer
one
stays
in
treatment
,
the
more
time
spent
toward
managing
cravings
and
other
negative
states
;
repairing
family
relationships
and
starting
new
,
healthier
networks
;
finding
new
modes
of
fulfillment
;
and
developing
realistic
future
plans
.
<EOS>
Importantly
,
after
initial
stabilization
and
detox
,
treatment
need
not
take
place
in
an
institution
.
<EOS>
Structured
supervision
,
ideally
supplemented
with
incentives
for
clean
drug
tests
and
immediate
consequences
,
boasts
a
promising
track
record
.
<EOS>
For
opiate
dependence
,
opiod-receptor
blockers
such
as
naltrexone
or
replacement
medications
such
as
buprenorphine
can
reduce
craving
considerably
.
<EOS>
Both
the
public
and
physicians
generally
endorse
involuntary
care
and
containment
for
psychotic
people
who
can'
t
care
for
themselves
or
pose
a
danger
to
others
.
<EOS>
The
same
for
suicidal
individuals
.
<EOS>
But
what
about
a
patient
just
revived
from
overdose
with
Narcan
(
which
instantly
reverses
opiate
overdose
)
?
<EOS>
If
this
person
walks
out
the
emergency
room
door
-
as
is
common
--
it
's
almost
guaranteed
he
or
she
will
hunt
for
more
drugs
.
<EOS>
To
a
physician
,
it
can
feel
like
abandonment
to
sign
the
patient
out
or
discharge
against
medical
advice
.
<EOS>
Severely
addicted
people
are
not
delusional
and
,
thus
,
not
intrinsically
beyond
reason
.
<EOS>
Nor
are
they
fully
autonomous
.
<EOS>
One
hopes
a
physician-initiated
three-day
hold
,
of
the
kind
Massachusetts
Governor
Baker
is
proposing
,
would
provide
a
respite
(
paired
with
a
signal
to
the
patient
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
)
during
which
he
or
she
ends
up
agreeing
to
long-term
care
.
<EOS>
Coercion
should
be
an
option
of
last
resort
for
those
at
grave
risk
.
<EOS>
But
if
help
is
still
refused
and
the
individual
is
therefore
mandated
to
monitored
quality
treatment
,
over
time
he
or
she
often
becomes
open
to
change
.
