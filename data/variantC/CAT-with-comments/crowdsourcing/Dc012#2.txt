COMMENT:
College
is
expensive
no
matter
what
people
say.
People
who
graduate
from
good
colleges
and
good
degrees
most
of
the
time
have
school
debt
in
the
ten
thousands.
Most
graduates
after
they
get
their
degrees
and
graduate
are
stuck
in
debt
from
what
they
had
done
in
colleges
like
the
classes,
cost
of
books,
and
living
expenses.
There
are
cases
everywhere
where
the
family
cannot
afford
to
pay
the
costs
for
books,
supplies,
and
tuition.
To
receive
financial
support
as
others
has
said
they
should
meet
a
set
of
requirements
to
be
able
to
receive
financial
aid.
If
they
are
determined
to
reach
a
higher
job
opportunity
they
do
whatever
it
takes
to
reach
the
goal
they
want
to
reach.
Yes
it
may
seem
unfair
to
the
people
who
won't
be
eligible
and
it
may
not
be
their
fault
as
my
teacher
has
told
me
"some
people
do
super
well
with
homework
but
are
just
god
awful
with
tests"
but
in
cases
they
just
don't
want
to
try
and
end
up
dropping
out
and
ending
up
with
debt
that
stacks
up
over
time
and
just
keeps
rising.
There
could
be
potential
faults
as
well.
As
the
students
who
reach
their
masters
and
doctoral
degrees
are
very
hard
and
take
a
tremendous
amount
of
years
to
obtain
could
become
easier
to
obtain
and
in
my
eyes
could
become
a
more
common
achievement.
Students
who
achieve
these
high
degrees
are
top
notch
students
who
study
endlessly.
Overall
all
I
believe
colleges
shouldn't
be
free
but
fees
should
be
decreased
and
more
financial
support
to
help
students.
<EOS>
The
Problem
Is
That
Free
College
Isn'
t
Free
.
<EOS>
``
Free
public
college
''
is
a
great
political
talking
point
,
but
it
is
flawed
policy
.
<EOS>
First
,
free
college
isn'
t
free
,
it
simply
shifts
costs
from
students
to
taxpayers
and
caps
tuition
at
zero
.
<EOS>
That
tuition
cap
limits
college
spending
to
whatever
the
public
is
willing
to
invest
.
<EOS>
But
it
does
not
change
the
cost
of
college
,
or
what
institutions
actually
spend
per
student
.
<EOS>
If
the
past
is
any
guide
,
that
cost
will
continue
to
grow
,
and
an
influx
of
federal
money
may
lead
profligate
administrators
to
spend
even
more
.
<EOS>
Enrollments
will
also
increase
,
further
multiplying
the
cost
of
free
college
.
<EOS>
The
key
question
,
then
,
is
what
happens
if
public
generosity
does
not
keep
pace
with
rising
college
costs
,
increases
in
demand
,
or
both
?
<EOS>
Barring
a
drastic
improvement
in
efficiency
,
tuition-free
colleges
won'
t
have
the
resources
to
serve
additional
students
without
compromising
the
quality
of
their
offerings
.
<EOS>
As
progressive
advocates
of
free
college
are
so
eager
to
point
out
,
public
funding
hasn'
t
kept
up
with
such
changes
in
the
past
.
<EOS>
For
instance
,
California
has
the
cheapest
community
college
fees
in
the
nation
.
<EOS>
During
the
recession
,
enrollments
boomed
and
the
state
budget
for
higher
education
took
a
hit
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
raise
additional
revenue
through
a
tuition
increase
,
California
's
community
colleges
turned
away
600,000
students
.
<EOS>
A
national
push
for
tuition-free
college
would
strain
public
budgets
even
further
,
leading
to
shortages
rather
than
increased
access
.
<EOS>
And
because
middle
and
upper-income
students
will
gobble
up
many
of
the
free
public
slots
,
rationing
will
hurt
those
who
need
access
the
most
.
<EOS>
Advocates
will
likely
argue
that
federal
policy
can
simply
force
policymakers
to
increase
funding
in
response
to
changes
.
<EOS>
But
today
's
political
coalition
will
be
hardpressed
to
tie
the
hands
of
tomorrow
's
,
especially
when
times
are
tough
.
<EOS>
Second
,
free
college
plans
assume
that
tuition
prices
are
the
main
obstacle
to
student
success
,
looking
past
problems
of
educational
quality
and
college
readiness
.
<EOS>
Take
community
colleges
,
where
federal
grants
cover
the
price
of
tuition
for
the
average
low-income
student
.
<EOS>
Despite
free
tuition
,
just
one-third
of
students
from
the
bottom
income
quartile
who
started
at
a
community
college
in
2003
finished
a
degree
or
certificate
by
2009
.
<EOS>
Two-year
students
from
the
top
income
quartile
didn'
t
do
much
better
(
42
percent
)
.
<EOS>
These
numbers
suggest
that
lackluster
outcomes
are
not
entirely
,
or
even
mostly
,
a
function
of
tuition
prices
,
but
reflect
deeper
problems
.
<EOS>
Like
the
fact
that
60
to
70
percent
of
community
college
students
have
to
take
at
least
one
remedial
course
,
as
do
40
percent
of
those
at
public
four-year
institutions
.
<EOS>
Or
the
fact
that
students
who
attend
public
four-year
colleges
with
lower
graduation
rates
are
less
likely
to
finish
than
similar
peers
who
attend
better
schools
.
<EOS>
Rather
than
spread
scarce
federal
money
across
all
students
,
policymakers
should
instead
target
those
resources
toward
those
who
need
it
most
and
empower
them
to
choose
the
option
-
public
or
private
-
that
fits
their
needs
.
<EOS>
A
valuable
degree
is
worth
the
investment
even
if
you
have
to
pay
something
for
it
.
<EOS>
