COMMENT:
Nonsense.
All
accidental
overdoses
and
deaths
are
caused
by
the
adulterated,
improperly
labeled,
and
improperly
manufactured
drugs
that
are
produced
by
the
current
illegalization
war.
Pure
opiates
such
as
morphine
and
its
analog
diacetylmorphine
(heroin)
packaged
in
safe
doses
are
100%
safe.
It
is
impossible
to
accidentally
overdose
on
properly
labeled
drugs
that
are
packaged
in
safe
doses
just
like
it
is
impossible
to
accidentally
jump
off
a
tall
building
or
accidentally
swallow
twenty
pills
instead
of
one
or
two.
Morphine
and
heroin
are
among
the
safest
drugs
known
to
mankind.
They
have
been
safely
produced
and
consumed
throughout
history.
Billions
of
human
beings
have
safely
consumed
opiates
and
have
benefited
from
their
use.
Unlike
the
hundreds
of
synthetic
pain
drugs
produced
by
Big
Pharma
(the
government
licensed
drug
cartel)
which
have
killed
millions
when
taken
as
directed,
opiates
are
safe.
A
person
can
consume
heroin
every
day
and
live
to
be
100
years
old
or
as
old
as
anyone
else.

Attract
Patients
to
Addiction
Treatment
,
Don'
t
Force
Them
Into
It
.
<EOS>
To
improve
both
addiction
treatment
access
and
success
,
we
need
less
coercion
,
not
more
.
<EOS>
Contrary
to
stereotype
,
by
the
time
addiction
sets
in
,
drug
use
isn'
t
particularly
pleasurable
and
many
people
with
addictions
are
well
aware
that
their
lives
have
gone
wrong
.
<EOS>
Sadly
,
they
also
know
that
treatment
is
often
designed
to
be
``
tough
love
''
-
and
is
not
only
likely
to
be
painful
,
but
ineffective
.
<EOS>
Would
you
seek
such
help
with
so
little
hope
?
<EOS>
In
fact
,
research
shows
that
the
most
effective
addiction
therapies
are
kind
,
welcoming
and
supportive
,
not
harsh
or
confrontational
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
hard
to
create
a
warm
atmosphere
in
a
setting
where
a
third
to
half
and
sometimes
more
of
participants
are
legally
mandated
and
staff
is
poorly
trained
and
underpaid
.
<EOS>
When
patients
consistently
avoid
other
types
of
care
,
providers
make
it
more
attractive
,
just
as
marketers
do
with
unwanted
consumer
products
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
decades
of
seeing
force
as
the
only
way
to
motivate
addicted
people
have
created
a
largely
inhospitable
system
that
views
harsh
and
disrespectful
treatment
as
not
only
acceptable
,
but
also
necessary
to
get
patients
to
realize
that
they
have
``
hit
bottom
.
''
<EOS>
This
,
in
turn
,
leads
to
calls
for
more
coercion
when
people
,
quite
reasonably
,
choose
not
to
enter
or
drop
out
,
creating
a
vicious
cycle
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
because
so
many
people
with
addictions
don'
t
attend
voluntarily
,
programs
have
little
incentive
to
become
user-friendly
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
goes
to
jail
if
rehab
fails
isn'
t
the
head
of
the
institution
or
its
counselors
,
it
's
the
patient
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
always
another
warm
body
from
the
justice
system
to
fill
empty
slots
,
when
failure
is
always
the
patient
's
fault
.
<EOS>
This
dysfunctional
system
further
stigmatizes
addiction
by
implying
that
punishment
is
necessary
in
treatment
,
unlike
for
any
other
disorder
.
<EOS>
Some
programs
,
to
their
great
credit
,
realized
the
need
for
change
when
AIDS
made
reaching
active
drug
users
to
reduce
needle
sharing
an
urgent
task
.
<EOS>
They
discovered
that
,
just
like
grandma
said
,
you
attract
more
flies
with
honey
than
with
vinegar
.
<EOS>
And
contrary
to
claims
that
coercion
is
necessary
,
research
on
needle
exchange
and
other
``
harm
reduction
''
programs
shows
that
they
attract
people
into
recovery
,
rather
than
extending
addiction
.
<EOS>
One
Vancouver
harm
reduction
program
got
57
percent
of
participants
into
treatment
.
<EOS>
To
most
effectively
use
our
limited
resources
,
we
need
treatment
that
attracts
patients
without
lazily
relying
on
coercion
.
<EOS>
Not
only
is
this
more
humane
,
it
's
also
cheaper
and
more
likely
to
result
in
lasting
recovery
.
<EOS>
