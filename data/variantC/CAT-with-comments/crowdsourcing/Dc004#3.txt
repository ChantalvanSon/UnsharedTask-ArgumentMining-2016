COMMENT:
I
know
I
paid
a
glance
at
this
discussion
last
time
it
was
paraded
out.
Tell
me
I'm
not
the
only
one.
Truth
be
told,
there's
not
a
man
jack
or
jenny
among
us
who
can't
find
himself
incarcerated,
first
for
those
72
hours
that
start
when
they
slap
the
shackles
on
your
wrist
...
the
thin
red
ring
of
blood
symbolic
of
the
cutting
us
off
from
"society"...
and
ending
God
only
knows
when
the
con
will
extricate
him
or
her
self
from
confinement
through
modifying
his
behavior
to
where
the
lip
service
is
paid
and
the
line
is
walked.
And
1.
there
is
no
wanting
the
authority,
usually
a
licensed
medical
examiner,
who
will
pocket
the
paycheck
for
signing
the
papers
putting
us
away.
And
2.
the
brother
and
sister
who
righteously
opine
on
what
in
God's
Green
Earth
is
to
be
done
with
them.
What
ya
gonna
do
when
they
puttin'
their
style
in
your
face?
As
our
community
will
not
better
the
common
good,
pull
ourselves
up
until
the
referent
is
"us"
rather
than
"them".
In
our
case
we
know
quite
well
who
the
correction
officers
are.

Compelled
Drug
Addiction
Treatment
Works
Because
of
Retention
.
<EOS>
There
is
little
question
that
civil
commitment
saves
lives
of
severely
addicted
people
in
the
short
term
by
abruptly
interrupting
cycles
of
extreme
self-destruction
.
<EOS>
This
acute
rescue
function
is
not
enough
,
however
.
<EOS>
While
everyone
prefers
that
patients
voluntarily
get
help
instead
of
being
forced
into
it
,
the
rate
of
drop-out
from
voluntary
commitment
after
several
weeks
is
a
common
problem
.
<EOS>
Drop
out
almost
always
means
relapse
.
<EOS>
Civil
commitment
-
with
patients
'
legal
right
to
challenge
,
of
course
-
provides
the
leverage
to
remain
in
care
.
<EOS>
But
can
treatment
work
if
it
is
compelled
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
There
is
ample
evidence
that
it
is
at
least
as
effective
,
and
sometimes
more
effective
,
than
voluntary
care
.
<EOS>
Again
,
the
reason
is
retention
:
The
longer
one
stays
in
treatment
,
the
more
time
spent
toward
managing
cravings
and
other
negative
states
;
repairing
family
relationships
and
starting
new
,
healthier
networks
;
finding
new
modes
of
fulfillment
;
and
developing
realistic
future
plans
.
<EOS>
Importantly
,
after
initial
stabilization
and
detox
,
treatment
need
not
take
place
in
an
institution
.
<EOS>
Structured
supervision
,
ideally
supplemented
with
incentives
for
clean
drug
tests
and
immediate
consequences
,
boasts
a
promising
track
record
.
<EOS>
For
opiate
dependence
,
opiod-receptor
blockers
such
as
naltrexone
or
replacement
medications
such
as
buprenorphine
can
reduce
craving
considerably
.
<EOS>
Both
the
public
and
physicians
generally
endorse
involuntary
care
and
containment
for
psychotic
people
who
can'
t
care
for
themselves
or
pose
a
danger
to
others
.
<EOS>
The
same
for
suicidal
individuals
.
<EOS>
But
what
about
a
patient
just
revived
from
overdose
with
Narcan
(
which
instantly
reverses
opiate
overdose
)
?
<EOS>
If
this
person
walks
out
the
emergency
room
door
-
as
is
common
--
it
's
almost
guaranteed
he
or
she
will
hunt
for
more
drugs
.
<EOS>
To
a
physician
,
it
can
feel
like
abandonment
to
sign
the
patient
out
or
discharge
against
medical
advice
.
<EOS>
Severely
addicted
people
are
not
delusional
and
,
thus
,
not
intrinsically
beyond
reason
.
<EOS>
Nor
are
they
fully
autonomous
.
<EOS>
One
hopes
a
physician-initiated
three-day
hold
,
of
the
kind
Massachusetts
Governor
Baker
is
proposing
,
would
provide
a
respite
(
paired
with
a
signal
to
the
patient
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
)
during
which
he
or
she
ends
up
agreeing
to
long-term
care
.
<EOS>
Coercion
should
be
an
option
of
last
resort
for
those
at
grave
risk
.
<EOS>
But
if
help
is
still
refused
and
the
individual
is
therefore
mandated
to
monitored
quality
treatment
,
over
time
he
or
she
often
becomes
open
to
change
.
<EOS>
