COMMENT:
having
worked
many
years
on
rehab/detox
units,
it
is
well
known
fact
addicts
have
to
1st
WANT
TO
STOP
using,
otherwise
it
is
a
waste
of
their
time
&
the
expense
is
HUGE,
i.e.,
if
the
goal
is
to
buy
them
a
few
more
years
of
life
living
a
horrific
lifestyle
due
to
forced
detox/rehab
now
&
then?
-this
hardly
seems
a
worthy
goal.
What
we
need
is
to
offer
detox
to
anyone
wanting
one
[physically
get
the
drugs
out
of
their
system
w/out
ill
effects
or
painful
withdrawl,
till
physically
stable.
Then
have
them
placed
in
the
community
with
extensive
supports;
if
homelessness
&
no
food
&
too
much
free
time;
find
them
a
bed,
a
home
&
food
co-op
[where
everyone
has
job
role/responsibilities],
&
something
purposeful
for
them
to
do
during
the
day
w/
fair
wages
[their
part
of
the
bargain
is
they
attend
daily
AA/NA
meetings;
otherwise
they
risk
loosing
the
bed/food/job]
We
can't
just
keep
recycling
homeless
addicts
12
x
year
in
hospitals
[way
it
works
now]
&
then
discharge
them
to
a
meaningless
life.
For
those
higher
functioning
that
are
not
living
in
poverty
[who
have
shelter,
food
&
job]
after
detox
have
them
agree
to
outpatient
drug
counselor
visits
every
day,
insist
they
get
a
sponsor
&
attend
daily
NA/AA
meetings
[better
&
more
honest
support
than
any
rehab
setting
can
offer,
less
expensive
&
more
successful].
For
anyone
NOT
voluntarily,
&
are
forced
via
MD
[extend
hospitalization
by
1
week
s/p
detox
&
follow
same
program
above
for
voluntary
detox.

Attract
Patients
to
Addiction
Treatment
,
Don'
t
Force
Them
Into
It
.
<EOS>
To
improve
both
addiction
treatment
access
and
success
,
we
need
less
coercion
,
not
more
.
<EOS>
Contrary
to
stereotype
,
by
the
time
addiction
sets
in
,
drug
use
isn'
t
particularly
pleasurable
and
many
people
with
addictions
are
well
aware
that
their
lives
have
gone
wrong
.
<EOS>
Sadly
,
they
also
know
that
treatment
is
often
designed
to
be
``
tough
love
''
-
and
is
not
only
likely
to
be
painful
,
but
ineffective
.
<EOS>
Would
you
seek
such
help
with
so
little
hope
?
<EOS>
In
fact
,
research
shows
that
the
most
effective
addiction
therapies
are
kind
,
welcoming
and
supportive
,
not
harsh
or
confrontational
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
hard
to
create
a
warm
atmosphere
in
a
setting
where
a
third
to
half
and
sometimes
more
of
participants
are
legally
mandated
and
staff
is
poorly
trained
and
underpaid
.
<EOS>
When
patients
consistently
avoid
other
types
of
care
,
providers
make
it
more
attractive
,
just
as
marketers
do
with
unwanted
consumer
products
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
decades
of
seeing
force
as
the
only
way
to
motivate
addicted
people
have
created
a
largely
inhospitable
system
that
views
harsh
and
disrespectful
treatment
as
not
only
acceptable
,
but
also
necessary
to
get
patients
to
realize
that
they
have
``
hit
bottom
.
''
<EOS>
This
,
in
turn
,
leads
to
calls
for
more
coercion
when
people
,
quite
reasonably
,
choose
not
to
enter
or
drop
out
,
creating
a
vicious
cycle
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
because
so
many
people
with
addictions
don'
t
attend
voluntarily
,
programs
have
little
incentive
to
become
user-friendly
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
goes
to
jail
if
rehab
fails
isn'
t
the
head
of
the
institution
or
its
counselors
,
it
's
the
patient
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
always
another
warm
body
from
the
justice
system
to
fill
empty
slots
,
when
failure
is
always
the
patient
's
fault
.
<EOS>
This
dysfunctional
system
further
stigmatizes
addiction
by
implying
that
punishment
is
necessary
in
treatment
,
unlike
for
any
other
disorder
.
<EOS>
Some
programs
,
to
their
great
credit
,
realized
the
need
for
change
when
AIDS
made
reaching
active
drug
users
to
reduce
needle
sharing
an
urgent
task
.
<EOS>
They
discovered
that
,
just
like
grandma
said
,
you
attract
more
flies
with
honey
than
with
vinegar
.
<EOS>
And
contrary
to
claims
that
coercion
is
necessary
,
research
on
needle
exchange
and
other
``
harm
reduction
''
programs
shows
that
they
attract
people
into
recovery
,
rather
than
extending
addiction
.
<EOS>
One
Vancouver
harm
reduction
program
got
57
percent
of
participants
into
treatment
.
<EOS>
To
most
effectively
use
our
limited
resources
,
we
need
treatment
that
attracts
patients
without
lazily
relying
on
coercion
.
<EOS>
Not
only
is
this
more
humane
,
it
's
also
cheaper
and
more
likely
to
result
in
lasting
recovery
.
<EOS>
