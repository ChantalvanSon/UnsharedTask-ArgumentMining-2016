COMMENT:
You
know,
the
posts
that
really
get
to
me
are
the
ones
who
say
"they
were
putting
holes
in
my
bedspread"
or
"He
went
right
up
the
blinds
so
we
had
him
declawed.
I
mean,
how
can
people
so
calmly
state
they
had
their
cats'
toes
cut
off
because
of
a
bedspread?
Instead
of
eagerly
cutting
off
the
cat's
toes,
why
didn't
their
vet
say
"oh
no,
this
isn't
necessary
at
all.
Put
the
bedspread
(or
blinds)
away
for
a
few
months
and
train
the
kitten
or
cat
when
and
where
to
use
her
claws.
This
is
done
by
providing
kitty
with
a
variety
of
scratching
surfaces.
Cats
have
a
lot
of
different
preferences.
Put
them
in
any
room
kitty
spends
a
lot
of
time,
especially
near
favorite
sleeping
spots.
Use
the
scratchers
when
you
play
with
kitty.
Daily
play
time
exercises
kitty's
body
and
mind,
which
prevents
boredom.
The
more
YOU
play
with
your
cat,
the
more
she
will
play
on
her
own--instead
of
digging
holes
in
the
rug.
This
is
what
people
in
the
rest
of
the
world
do,
with
their
cats.
Once
kitty
is
grown
up,
and
is
trained
to
use
and
jump
and
play
on
her
own
things,
you
can
put
your
bedspread
back
out.
"
That
is
what
vets
should
be
saying.

Declawing
Must
Be
an
Option
to
Save
Cats
'
Lives
.
<EOS>
New
York
State
is
considering
making
it
a
crime
to
have
a
pet
cat
declawed
.
<EOS>
But
why
is
this
an
issue
now
,
when
breed
standards
and
mutilation
of
dogs
are
more
common
and
cause
more
death
?
<EOS>
Many
breed
standards
kill
animals
or
significantly
decrease
their
longevity
;
and
ear
cropping
and
tail
docking
are
unnecessary
cosmetic
surgeries
that
are
illegal
in
much
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
In
addition
,
overt
animal
abuse
and
cat
hoarding
,
where
animals
truly
suffer
,
are
rarely
investigated
or
corrected
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
time
and
resources
are
being
focused
on
cat
declawing
legislation
.
<EOS>
Cat
declawing
,
or
onychectomy
,
like
any
surgery
,
should
only
be
the
last
resort
,
that
is
,
when
not
doing
so
is
worse
and
could
lead
to
the
cat
's
death
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
is
debate
because
declawing
is
viewed
as
a
``
cosmetic
surgery
''
needed
more
for
the
owner
than
the
cat
.
<EOS>
While
this
is
sometimes
true
,
the
epidemiology
of
cat
survival
makes
a
different
compelling
case
.
<EOS>
Contrary
to
popular
belief
,
there
appears
to
be
no
significant
dog
and
cat
overpopulation
documented
by
the
successful
supply
of
dogs
from
commercial
and
private
breeders
and
the
continued
decrease
in
cat
numbers
because
household
have
fewer
of
them
.
<EOS>
What
is
happening
is
that
there
are
too
many
adult
pets
being
surrendered
to
shelters
,
many
to
die
.
<EOS>
The
most
common
reason
for
relinquishment
are
behavior
problems
.
<EOS>
For
cats
,
the
problems
are
spraying
and
property
damage
cause
by
scratching
.
<EOS>
There
are
strategies
to
lessen
behavior
problems
but
many
cats
are
just
not
able
to
resist
scratching
so
owners
abandon
them
or
give
them
to
shelters
.
<EOS>
Cat
declawing
,
as
a
last
resort
,
is
a
reasonable
alternative
.
<EOS>
Research
I
've
conducted
with
colleagues
shows
that
declawed
cats
stay
in
people
's
homes
longer
;
that
is
,
it
keeps
people
from
giving
their
cats
away
.
<EOS>
Declawed
cats
do
not
exhibit
any
more
bad
behaviors
,
including
biting
of
people
,
than
cats
that
are
not
declawed
.
<EOS>
Another
very
important
issue
is
the
death
of
small
wild
mammals
and
birds
.
<EOS>
Studies
show
that
cats
do
considerable
damage
to
wildlife
.
<EOS>
I
would
like
to
see
study
on
whether
declawed
cats
kill
fewer
song
birds
,
which
is
a
growing
problem
around
the
world
,
and
a
major
reason
for
catching
stray
cats
.
<EOS>
Declawed
cats
are
kept
as
indoor
pets
more
than
non-declawed
pets
,
and
being
home
will
protect
wildlife
.
<EOS>
Declawing
a
cat
should
be
viewed
as
a
last
resort
and
should
not
be
a
crime
.
<EOS>
