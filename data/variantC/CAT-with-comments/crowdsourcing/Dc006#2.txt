COMMENT:
Polls
have
value,
but
I
think
that
value
currently
is
over-stated.
We
have
had
months
of
presidential
polls,
beginning
well
before
the
first
debate
and
obviously
way
ahead
of
the
first
primary.
This
means
some
candidates
are
counted
as
virtually
eliminated
prior
to
having
an
opportunity
to
debate
their
opponents
or
even
to
introduce
themselves
and
their
policy
positions
to
the
voters.
I'm
not
sure
there
is
a
great
alternative
to
this.
Prior
to
the
current
prominence
of
polling,
candidates
were
eliminated
at
this
very
early
stage,
because
their
pile
of
campaign
cash
was
deemed
too
small.
With
unlimited
contributions
possible
from
a
few
big
contributors,
perhaps
the
current
reliance
on
polling
is
fairer.
Still,
it
seemed
unfair
to
exclude
candidates
from
the
big
debate
table,
based
entirely
upon
polls.
In
my
list
of
things
harmful
to
democracy,
a
lot
of
things
associated
with
picking
each
party's
presidential
nominee
seem
more
harmful.
Caucuses
in
place
of
primaries
are
awful.
We
say
we
want
voter
participation,
then
create
a
process
which
makes
voting
far
more
time
consuming.
Just
having
Iowa
and
N.H.
go
first
each
election
is
manifestly
unfair
and
warps
all
of
the
peoples'
ability
to
choose
the
best
nominee
nearly
impossible.
Last
election,
Santorum
actually
won
the
Iowa
caucus,
but
the
Iowa
Republican
Committee
awarded
the
win
to
Romney
and
didn't
issue
a
correction
until
it
was
too
late
to
matter.
Now
that
really
harms
democracy.

Polls
Can

Polls
are
a
popular
whipping-boy
in
politics
.
<EOS>
They
are
blamed
for
politicians
'
bad
decisions
and
the
poor
state
of
democracy
.
<EOS>
This
,
despite
the
fact
that
in
most
elections
in
America
,
which
occur
at
the
local
level
,
there
are
no
polls
because
candidates
can'
t
afford
them
or
the
locality
is
so
small
that
you
really
don'
t
need
a
poll
.
<EOS>
Even
without
polls
,
the
same
complaints
emerge
.
<EOS>
Many
people
complain
about
their
local
politicians
'
bad
decisions
and
the
poor
state
of
democracy
.
<EOS>
People
complain
because
politics
entails
conflicts
that
result
in
lots
of
people
not
getting
what
they
want
(
i.e.
,
they
lose
elections
or
legislative
votes
)
.
<EOS>
Many
people
who
don'
t
get
what
they
want
need
something
to
blame
-
so
they
blame
the
polls
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
that
polls
are
destroying
democracy
,
then
think
about
an
alternative
.
<EOS>
Without
polls
,
politicians
,
special
interests
and
certain
members
of
the
news
media
would
still
have
strong
incentives
to
make
forceful
claims
about
the
public
's
views
.
<EOS>
Unconstrained
by
credible
polling
data
,
these
individuals
could
spin
incredible
stories
about
the
great
public
support
for
their
endeavors
.
<EOS>
This
,
by
the
way
,
is
not
a
hypothetical
situation
.
<EOS>
It
is
exactly
how
claims
about
public
opinion
are
circulated
and
adjudicated
in
a
range
of
democratic
and
authoritarian
regimes
that
lack
credible
polling
organizations
.
<EOS>
Without
good
polls
,
it
is
difficult
or
impossible
to
confront
bold
claims
by
powerful
people
.

Ask
Vladimir
Putin

<EOS>
Polls
are
imperfect
.
<EOS>
They
always
have
been
.
<EOS>
It
has
always
been
challenging
to
draw
accurate
inferences
about
a
large
population
by
interviewing
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
population
.
<EOS>
The
best
pollsters
understand
this
.
<EOS>
Professional
polling
organizations
,
such
as
the
American
Association
of
Public
Opinion
Researchers
,
work
hard
to
help
polling
organizations
establish
rigorous
best
practices
and
help
individuals
learn
as
much
as
possible
from
polling
data
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
many
second-rate
polling
organizations
try
to
pass
themselves
off
as
credible
sources
of
information
despite
their
cut-rate
methods
and
carelessness
in
reporting
critical
characteristics
of
their
data
(
such
as
response
rates
)
.
<EOS>
If
polling
organizations
are
honest
about
what
they
have
,
and
if
media
organizations
do
their
part
and
help
their
audiences
differentiate
reliable
polls
from
unreliable
polls
,
polls
can
strengthen
democracy
by
providing
important
information
about
what
citizens
want
and
think
.
