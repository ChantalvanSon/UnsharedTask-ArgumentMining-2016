Teacher
Evaluations
Could
Be
Hurting
Faculty
Diversity
at
Universities
.
<EOS>
Recent
college
student
protests
calling
for
increased
faculty
diversity
left
people
wondering
why
there
aren'
t
more
fulltime
faculty
of
color
in
our
universities
.
<EOS>
One
reason
may
be
that
faculty
of
color
are
not
retained
at
the
same
rate
as
their
white
counterparts
,
and
bias
in
student
teaching
evaluations
could
be
contributing
to
that
disparity
.
<EOS>
A
public
example
of
student
evaluation
of
college
teaching
can
be
found
on
Rate
My
Professors
.
<EOS>
The
problem
with
such
evaluative
tools
,
according
to
research
by
the
American
Association
of
University
Professors
,
is
that
students
with
extreme
views
are
more
likely
to
complete
an
evaluation
of
a
teacher
.
<EOS>
In
these
instances
,
the
``
sample
''
of
students
surveyed
about
the
professor
's
performance
is
skewed
,
tainting
the
validity
of
the
findings
.
<EOS>
Using
student
evaluations
for
promotion
and
retention
decisions
without
supplemental
data
is
also
troubling
in
light
of
research
finding
that
when
whites
rate
the
performance
of
a
person
of
color
for
the
purposes
of
giving
feedback
to
a
third
party
,
they
consistently
rate
the
person
of
color
lower
than
the
white
person
.
<EOS>
Conversely
,
when
whites
evaluate
a
person
of
color
for
purposes
of
giving
feedback
to
that
person
directly
,
the
person
of
color
being
evaluated
actually
receives
more
favorable
marks
than
the
white
person
being
evaluated
.
<EOS>
What
's
more
,
in
Deborah
Rhode
's
fascinating
book
,
``
The
Beauty
Bias
,
''
we
learn
that
evaluators
are
more
likely
to
rate
physically
attractive
performers
more
favorably
than
those
deemed
unattractive
,
and
that
people
with
strong
African
physical
features
are
deemed
less
attractive
than
those
without
such
features
.
<EOS>
With
all
of
this
bias
in
student
evaluations
,
we
should
be
cautious
in
using
them
to
make
employment
decisions
.
<EOS>
As
the
consumers
of
higher
education
,
student
voices
are
important
.
<EOS>
But
using
student
evaluations
to
make
employment
retention
decisions
may
be
allowing
hidden
bias
to
frustrate
efforts
to
diversify
our
faculties
.
