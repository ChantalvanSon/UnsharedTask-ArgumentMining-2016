COMMENT:
Over
time
this
issue
will
be
moot
as
the
vast
majority
of
college
learning
occurs
online,
with
a
very
few
outstanding
professors
in
each
area.
Exactly
why
are
we
waiting
to
create
a
free
online
university
as
a
public
good,
much
like
the
Internet
itself
or
the
interstate
highway
system
?
Why
not
put
students
in
charge
of
their
education,
to
be
done
at
their
convenience,
and
at
their
own
pace
?
We
know
that
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
college
"research"
is
ever
cited
again,
so
that
the
research
function
can
continue
to
be
done
by
the
top
50
or
universities
who
do
that
important
work
today.
Practical,
hands-on
work
can
be
done
in
community
colleges.
But
the
huge
bulk
of
traditional
colleges
that
we
subsidize
with
hundreds
of
billions
annually
need
to
simply
go
away.

Teacher
Evaluations
Could
Be
Hurting
Faculty
Diversity
at
Universities
.
<EOS>
Recent
college
student
protests
calling
for
increased
faculty
diversity
left
people
wondering
why
there
aren'
t
more
fulltime
faculty
of
color
in
our
universities
.
<EOS>
One
reason
may
be
that
faculty
of
color
are
not
retained
at
the
same
rate
as
their
white
counterparts
,
and
bias
in
student
teaching
evaluations
could
be
contributing
to
that
disparity
.
<EOS>
A
public
example
of
student
evaluation
of
college
teaching
can
be
found
on
Rate
My
Professors
.
<EOS>
The
problem
with
such
evaluative
tools
,
according
to
research
by
the
American
Association
of
University
Professors
,
is
that
students
with
extreme
views
are
more
likely
to
complete
an
evaluation
of
a
teacher
.
<EOS>
In
these
instances
,
the
``
sample
''
of
students
surveyed
about
the
professor
's
performance
is
skewed
,
tainting
the
validity
of
the
findings
.
<EOS>
Using
student
evaluations
for
promotion
and
retention
decisions
without
supplemental
data
is
also
troubling
in
light
of
research
finding
that
when
whites
rate
the
performance
of
a
person
of
color
for
the
purposes
of
giving
feedback
to
a
third
party
,
they
consistently
rate
the
person
of
color
lower
than
the
white
person
.
<EOS>
Conversely
,
when
whites
evaluate
a
person
of
color
for
purposes
of
giving
feedback
to
that
person
directly
,
the
person
of
color
being
evaluated
actually
receives
more
favorable
marks
than
the
white
person
being
evaluated
.
<EOS>
What
's
more
,
in
Deborah
Rhode
's
fascinating
book
,
``
The
Beauty
Bias
,
''
we
learn
that
evaluators
are
more
likely
to
rate
physically
attractive
performers
more
favorably
than
those
deemed
unattractive
,
and
that
people
with
strong
African
physical
features
are
deemed
less
attractive
than
those
without
such
features
.
<EOS>
With
all
of
this
bias
in
student
evaluations
,
we
should
be
cautious
in
using
them
to
make
employment
decisions
.
<EOS>
As
the
consumers
of
higher
education
,
student
voices
are
important
.
<EOS>
But
using
student
evaluations
to
make
employment
retention
decisions
may
be
allowing
hidden
bias
to
frustrate
efforts
to
diversify
our
faculties
.
