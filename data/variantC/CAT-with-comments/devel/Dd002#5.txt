COMMENT:
My
experience
at
a
Seven
Sisters
college
happened
many
years
ago,
but
I
have
been
profoundly
grateful
for
it
ever
since.
I
can't
say
that
I
changed
as
much
as
I
might
have
while
I
was
in
college
-
I
arrived
shy,
awkward,
and
lacking
self-confidence,
and
four
years
later
I
emerged
still
shy,
still
awkward,
and
with
not
much
more
self-confidence.
But
I
learned
a
great
deal
about
how
women
can
approach
life
from
my
professors
and
from
my
classmates,
and
their
example
has
made
a
significant
difference
in
my
ability
to
emerge
from
my
shell.
If
I
had
attended
a
co-ed
college,
I
would
simply
have
disappeared.
I
owe
more
to
Smith
College
than
I
can
possibly
express.

The
Freeing
Powers
of
Single-Sex
Education
.
<EOS>
Years
ago
,
during
a
classroom
visit
,
I
observed
a
small
group
of
black
and
Latino
high
school
boys
sitting
at
their
desks
looking
into
handheld
mirrors
.
<EOS>
They
were
tasked
with
answering
the
question
,
``
What
do
you
see
?
''
<EOS>
One
boy
said
,
``
I
see
an
ugly
face
.
''
<EOS>
Another
said
,
``
I
see
a
big
nose
.
''
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
many
moments
I
observed
in
single-sex
schools
where
black
and
Latino
boys
felt
comfortable
,
and
allowed
,
to
express
their
emotions
,
changing
notions
about
a
one
dimensional
image
of
masculinity
.
<EOS>
Our
society
is
partly
responsible
for
the
ways
in
which
gender-based
expectations
can
be
reinforced
and
,
over
time
,
those
expectations
can
help
create
vulnerable
situations
that
lead
to
limited
economic
mobility
,
job
opportunity
and
leadership
development
.
<EOS>
A
benefit
of
single-sex
environments
is
the
opportunity
for
cognitive
expansion
that
can
exist
alongside
multifaceted
displays
of
masculinity
and
femininity
.
<EOS>
In
single-sex
education
,
teachers
make
an
understanding
of
race
,
ethnicity
,
linguistic
diversity
,
masculinity
,
femininity
and
sexuality
a
profound
part
of
their
educational
mission
.
<EOS>
Such
identity-driven
missions
create
protective
environments
,
like
the
ones
found
in
single-sex
high
schools
like
Urban
Prep
Academy
and
Eagle
Academy
,
and
colleges
like
Bryn
Mawr
,
Spelman
and
Morehouse
.
<EOS>
Overall
,
the
closing
of
single-sex
colleges
like
Sweet
Briar
may
be
more
indicative
of
economic
and
demographic
dynamics
-
stagnant
high
school
graduation
and
college
readiness
,
increasing
college
costs
and
the
rise
in
online
education
-
rather
than
a
drop
in
importance
and
relevance
for
environments
where
``
Who
I
am
''
and
``
Who
I
want
to
be
''
take
center
stage
.
<EOS>
Those
questions
,
safely
explored
,
allow
students
to
develop
in
healthy
cognitive
,
social
and
emotional
ways
,
with
gender
nonconforming
values
.
