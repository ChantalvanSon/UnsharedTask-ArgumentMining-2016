COMMENT:
I
support
Jacobs's
claim
because
happy
hour
increases
the
chances
of
drunk
driving.
In
other
words,
I
believe
that
offering
people
cheap
alcohol
for
an
hour
gives
them
the
opportunity
to
binge
on
drinks
legally
then
make
insensible
decision
which
often
leads
into
accidents.
In
fact,
Jessica
Wohl
and
Greg
Trotter
from
the
Chicago
Tribune
who
are
addressing
the
return
of
happy
hour
in
Illinois
state
that,
"In
1988,
the
year
before
the
happy
hour
ban
went
into
effect,
912,
or
49.6
percent,
of
the
1,837
fatal
crashes
in
Illinois
were
alcohol-related."
That
49.6%
of
crashes
should
not
repeat
itself
for
the
sake
of
the
people
and
their
safety.
Although
some
customers
might
object
that
happy
hour
helps
them
to
financially
and
socially
enjoy
themselves,
I
maintain
that
some
people
take
that
opportunity
to
indulge
themselves
into
alcohol
and
it
is
those
people
that
cause
so
much
trouble
for
others
on
the
road.
Therefore,
I
conclude
that
happy
hour
endangers
society
by
enabling
customers
to
rightfully
drink
irresponsibly.

There
's
Nothing

Happy
'
About

I

I
strongly
oppose
the
reinstitution
of
happy
hours
in
Illinois
.
<EOS>
Happy
hours
were
banned
in
Illinois
in
1989
for
good
reason
:
Happy
hour
discounts
encouraged
excessive
drinking
during
a
short
period
of
time
.
<EOS>
People
were
getting
drunk
off
cheap
drinks
,
driving
drunk
and
causing
harm
(
and
sometimes
death
)
to
themselves
and
others
.
<EOS>
When
I
wrote
about
my
opposition
to
happy
hours
on
my
Facebook
page
last
week
,
a
friend
told
me
of
the
tragic
death
of
her
close
friend
,
a
freshman
at
Eastern
Illinois
University
,
who
was
on
her
way
home
for
Thanksgiving
break
in
1987
when
the
car
she
was
riding
in
was
hit
by
a
driver
who
had
just
left
a
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
Supporters
of
the
bill
say
it
will
let
Chicago
compete
with
other
cities
for
tourist
dollars
.
<EOS>
But
will
tourists
flock
to
Chicago
because
they
can
drink
more
for
less
at
happy
hour
?
<EOS>
Right

Only

Last
time
I
listened
to
Frank
Sinatra
's
``
Chicago
,
''
there
was
no
mention
of
cheap
happy
hour
drinks
.
<EOS>
And
,
frankly
,
people
are
more
likely
to
come
to
Chicago
to
see
that
man
who
danced
with
his
wife
than
they
are
to
come
here
to
binge
cheaply
at
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
Chicago
toddles
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
$
1
drinks
between
5
and
7
.
<EOS>
The
competition
will
not
be
between
Chicago
and
San
Francisco
and
Miami
for
tourist
dollars
but
between
watering
holes
seeking
to
out-happy
hour
each
other
by
offering
the
most
intoxicating
drink
offers
,
as
it
was
in
the
halcyon
days
of
Chicago
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
According
to
the
United
States
Department
of
Transportation
,
there
were
393
alcohol-related
traffic
fatalities
in
Illinois
in
2012
-
a
year
in
which
happy
hour
was
outlawed
in
Illinois
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
to
say
that
the
reinstitution
of
happy
hour
,
with
its
drunken
hordes
stumbling
forth
onto
Illinois
'
roads
,
is
not
likely
to
make
Illinois
'
roads
safer
.
<EOS>
Let
's
not
trade
lives
for
revenues
.

Governor
Rauner
,
don'
t
sign
this
bill
.
