COMMENT:
How
sad
it
is
for
one
to
comment
about
a
place
they
have
never
visited
or
an
experience
they
have
never
had
themselves!
The
proudest
moment
for
me
was
when
my
daughter
received
her
Sweet
Briar
Admission
letter
and
it
included
the
same
honor
code
that
was
in
my
own
admission
letter!
Even
prouder
is
knowing
she
is
an
SBC
graduate
and
never
would
have
pursued
a
degree
in
business
had
she
not
been
in
a
place
that
allowed
her
the
freedom
to
be
a
scholar,
an
athlete,
receive
an
excellent
education
in
a
free
thinking
environment,
develop
wonderful
friendships
to
last
a
lifetime,
participate
in
the
honor
and
traditions
of
SBC
and
be
an
independent
gracious
strong
young
woman
who
is
looking
forward
to
raising
her
own
family!
The
saddest
day
was
receiving
her
tear-filled
phone
call
and
then
seeing
her
crying
face
in
the
first
picture
taken
of
students
leaving
Babcock
after
the
announcement,
now
all
over
the
WWW!
To
spend
the
next
day
with
her
in
the
bookshop
buying
memorabilia
and
baby
clothes
while
she
and
her
friends,
alumni,
faculty,
parents-
further,
with
tear-filled
eyes,
spoke
of
their
love
for
Sweet
Briar
knowing
they
would
never
be
able
to
share
the
experience
with
their
daughters.
To
learn
where
you
are
going
you
need
the
past.....Sweet
Briar
offers
that
and
much
much
more!

Sweet
Briar
Is
Fighting
an
Up-Hill
Battle
.
<EOS>
Despite
a
beautiful
campus
,
dedicated
faculty
,
loyal
alumnae
and
a
significant
endowment
,
Sweet
Briar
College
is
closing
after
114
years
.
<EOS>
Too
few
students
were
choosing
Sweet
Briar
,
so
the
college
discounted
its
tuition
rate
,
a
move
that
exacerbated
its
financial
problems
but
did
not
succeed
in
attracting
enough
students
.
<EOS>
As
a
small
,
rural
,
liberal
arts
women
's
college
,
Sweet
Briar
was
fighting
an
up-hill
battle
against
many
trends
in
higher
education
.
<EOS>
Although
all
of
these
variables
probably
contributed
to
the
lack
of
student
interest
,
President
James
Jones
,
Jr.
acknowledged
that
declining
interest
in
single-sex
education
was
decisive
in
its
demise
.
<EOS>
Data
supports
this
conclusion
:
According
to
the
Women
's
College
Coalition
,
the
number
of
women
's
colleges
declined
from
230
to
little
more
than
40
in
the
last
half-century
.
<EOS>
By
many
measures
,
today
's
women
are
flourishing
in
higher
education
and
do
not
need
a
protected
environment
to
develop
their
intellectual
potential
.
<EOS>
Women
are
enrolled
in
higher
education
at
higher
rates
than
men
and
achieve
better
grades
.
<EOS>
Young
women
are
at
or
near
parity
in
many
``
traditionally
male
''
professions
including
law
and
medicine
.
<EOS>
While
women
are
still
underrepresented
in
positions
of
leadership
and
in
some
,
but
not
all
,
math-intensive
disciplines
,
there
is
no
data
to
support
the
myth
that
single-sex
colleges
prepare
women
better
to
become
leaders
in
our
co-ed
world
or
that
their
graduates
are
more
likely
to
choose
math-intensive
career
options
.
<EOS>
The
popular
idea
that
single-sex
education
benefits
women
comes
from
anecdotes
about
female
leaders
who
were
educated
in
an
era
when
elite
colleges
did
not
admit
them
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
Hillary
Clinton
attended
Wellesley
College
,
but
she
also
graduated
from
Yale
Law
School
,
which
was
co-ed
.
