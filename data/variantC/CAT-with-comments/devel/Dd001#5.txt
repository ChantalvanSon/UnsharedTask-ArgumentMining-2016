COMMENT:
The
New
York
Times
ran
an
article
on
March
5,
on
Elaine
Pao,
on
how
women
in
the
workplace
are
judged
as
bossy
or
abrasive,
if
they
assert
themselves.
Other
news
media
add
to
that
that
if
they
don't,
they
are
told
they
are
too
quiet
and
deferential
for
promotion
and
responsibility.
Some
add
that
women
are
the
worst
judges
of
other
women.
Having
graduated
from
one
women's
college
(Smith)
and
now
teaching
at
another
(Sweet
Briar),
I
would
say
that
women
who
have
gone
to
women's
colleges
do
not
share
these
disappointing
biases.
Assertive
women?
Women
proud
and
confident
to
display
mastery
of
a
problem,
and
to
argue
their
perspective
over
and
against
that
of
a
superior?
These
women
are
common
as
peas
here:
we
respect
them,
and
expect
them.
Our
students
also
learn
to
respect
that
quiet
one
-
for
they
know
that
one
may
have
the
sharpest
insights,
once
invited
to
speak.
Of
course,
not
all
women
should
go
to
women's
colleges.
And
those
who
do
have
a
range
of
experiences
and
come
out
with
diverse
strengths
and
capabilities.
And
of
course
there
are
all
sorts
of
social
tensions
flaring
in
any
residential
campus,
all-female
or
co-ed.
But
one
thing
students
learn
at
an
all-women's
college
is
to
respect
other
women,
in
all
their
diversity.

Sweet
Briar
Is
Fighting
an
Up-Hill
Battle
.
<EOS>
Despite
a
beautiful
campus
,
dedicated
faculty
,
loyal
alumnae
and
a
significant
endowment
,
Sweet
Briar
College
is
closing
after
114
years
.
<EOS>
Too
few
students
were
choosing
Sweet
Briar
,
so
the
college
discounted
its
tuition
rate
,
a
move
that
exacerbated
its
financial
problems
but
did
not
succeed
in
attracting
enough
students
.
<EOS>
As
a
small
,
rural
,
liberal
arts
women
's
college
,
Sweet
Briar
was
fighting
an
up-hill
battle
against
many
trends
in
higher
education
.
<EOS>
Although
all
of
these
variables
probably
contributed
to
the
lack
of
student
interest
,
President
James
Jones
,
Jr.
acknowledged
that
declining
interest
in
single-sex
education
was
decisive
in
its
demise
.
<EOS>
Data
supports
this
conclusion
:
According
to
the
Women
's
College
Coalition
,
the
number
of
women
's
colleges
declined
from
230
to
little
more
than
40
in
the
last
half-century
.
<EOS>
By
many
measures
,
today
's
women
are
flourishing
in
higher
education
and
do
not
need
a
protected
environment
to
develop
their
intellectual
potential
.
<EOS>
Women
are
enrolled
in
higher
education
at
higher
rates
than
men
and
achieve
better
grades
.
<EOS>
Young
women
are
at
or
near
parity
in
many
``
traditionally
male
''
professions
including
law
and
medicine
.
<EOS>
While
women
are
still
underrepresented
in
positions
of
leadership
and
in
some
,
but
not
all
,
math-intensive
disciplines
,
there
is
no
data
to
support
the
myth
that
single-sex
colleges
prepare
women
better
to
become
leaders
in
our
co-ed
world
or
that
their
graduates
are
more
likely
to
choose
math-intensive
career
options
.
<EOS>
The
popular
idea
that
single-sex
education
benefits
women
comes
from
anecdotes
about
female
leaders
who
were
educated
in
an
era
when
elite
colleges
did
not
admit
them
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
Hillary
Clinton
attended
Wellesley
College
,
but
she
also
graduated
from
Yale
Law
School
,
which
was
co-ed
.
