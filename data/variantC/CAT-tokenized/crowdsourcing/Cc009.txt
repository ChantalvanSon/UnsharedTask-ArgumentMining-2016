Declawing
a
Pet
Should
Be
Illegal
,
Period
.
<EOS>
Declawing
is
not
some
sort
of
specialized
manicure
that
only
a
vet
can
do
,
it
is
amputation
of
the
toe
bones
that
contain
the
claws
.
<EOS>
Legislation
prohibiting
this
surgery
is
necessary
to
protect
cats
from
this
often
debilitating
procedure
.
<EOS>
The
United
States
veterinary
profession
has
rationalized
breaking
its
oath
to
``
do
no
harm
''
when
it
comes
to
declawing
.
<EOS>
Vets
will
say
that
by
declawing
a
cat
,
they
are
ensuring
a
cat
a
home
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
how
they
can
say
that
.
<EOS>
If
an
owner
is
so
intolerant
of
a
cat
scratching
furniture
,
that
same
owner
is
not
likely
to
be
tolerant
when
his
declawed
cat
stops
using
the
litter
box
because
the
sand
hurts
its
amputated
toe
nubs
,
or
when
that
cat
starts
biting
to
protect
itself
because
it
has
no
claws
.
<EOS>
Both
of
these
behavior
problems
have
been
noticed
in
cats
after
declawing
.
<EOS>
Vets
also
offer
another
unfounded
excuse
that
they
only
declaw
cats
to
protect
immuno-compromised
humans
.
<EOS>
But
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
says
that
declawing
the
cats
of
people
living
with
immuno-compromised
individuals
is
``
not
advised
.
''
<EOS>
In
many
countries
,
declawing
is
illegal
or
considered
unethical
by
veterinary
professionals
,
and
there
,
immuno-compromised
people
are
able
to
cope
with
cat
claws
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
declawed
cats
,
especially
those
in
pain
,
are
likely
to
bite
harder
and
more
often
than
their
clawed
counterparts
.
<EOS>
Bite
wounds
are
almost
always
far
more
serious
than
scratches
.
<EOS>
Although
some
veterinarians
offer
discount
coupons
for
declawing
and
most
recommend
only
declawing
kittens
or
cats
under
two
years
,
many
vets
will
claim
that
they
declaw
as
a
``
last
resort
,
''
after
all
humane
options
have
failed
.
<EOS>
They
will
say
that
they
try
to
talk
everyone
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
that
is
true
,
why
does
the
New
York
State
Veterinary
Medical
Society
oppose
this
bill
?
<EOS>
Isn'
t
the
ultimate
way
to
talk
people
out
of
declawing
simply
to
say
it
is
illegal
?
