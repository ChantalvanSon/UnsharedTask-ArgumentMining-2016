Politicians
Use
Polls
to
Adjust
Their
Message
.
<EOS>
As
part
of
a
permanent
campaign
,
political
leaders
use
polls
to
craft
their
language
,
track
responses
to
their
speeches
and
identify
who
is
for
them
,
who
against
them
,
and
why
.
<EOS>
Polling
helps
politicians
maintain
and
expand
their
coalition
from
one
election
to
the
next
by
tracking
attitudes
.
<EOS>
Politicians
also
benefit
from
polling
in
the
same
way
companies
marketing
a
product
do
.
<EOS>
It
is
easier
to
persuade
when
you
understand
your
audience
.
<EOS>
The
Reagan
administration
discovered
that
calling
a
space-based
defense
program
``
Star
Wars
''
appealed
to
the
public
more
than
when
it
was
called
the
``
Strategic
Defense
Initiative
.
''
<EOS>
The
benefit
for
the
public
is
less
obvious
.
<EOS>
A
representative
democracy
is
based
on
input
from
the
public
in
elections
.
<EOS>
Some
citizens
take
the
democratic
mandate
further
and
express
their
opinions
by
contacting
their
elected
officials
,
or
by
holding
up
signs
on
street
corners
,
or
by
marching
on
Washington
.
<EOS>
In
any
of
those
scenarios
,
citizen
preferences
drive
participation
.
<EOS>
Many
citizens
do
not
actively
participate
,
even
in
elections
.
<EOS>
However
,
polls
collect
the
opinions
of
all
citizens
whether
they
are
active
,
inactive
,
partisan
,
independent
,
knowledgeable
,
disconnected
or
oblivious
.
<EOS>
While
we
want
more
participation
,
gathering
the
opinions
of
the
inattentive
or
unknowledgeable
does
not
add
value
to
the
policy-making
process
.
<EOS>
The
quality
and
use
of
polling
data
can
also
raise
concerns
.
<EOS>
Most
polls
reveal
simplistic
preferences
:
``
Yes
,
I
agree
;
''
or
``
No
,
I
`
t
.
''
<EOS>
Answering
a
complex
,
multifaceted
question
requires
the
respondent
to
understand
the
question
,
the
choices
and
to
truly
have
a
preference
.
<EOS>
If
polls
are
used
to
identify
persuasive
language
,
then
our
attitudes
can
suborn
support
.
<EOS>
Knowledge
of
poll
data
can
also
persuade
:
learning
that
55
percent
of
Americans
believe
something
or
support
someone
can
produce
a
bandwagon
effect
for
those
with
limited
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Plus
,
close
poll
results
that
fall
within
the
margin
of
error
make
positions
on
policy
appear
certain
when
they
are
actually
uncertain
.
<EOS>
Citizens
want
their
views
represented
while
decisions
are
being
made
.
<EOS>
Polls
provide
that
opportunity
in
a
way
that
elections
do
not
.
<EOS>
But
politicians
control
how
polls
are
used
,
and
if
used
to
manipulate
,
then
we
may
be
worse
off
than
if
we
didn'
t
have
them
at
all
.
