As a small, rural, liberal arts women's college, Sweet Briar was fighting an  up-hill battle against many trends in higher education.

"Dd002.txt","Are Same-Sex Colleges Still Relevant?","Do same-sex colleges play an important role in education, or are they outdated?","The Freeing Powers of Single-Sex Education","#8","LaChavalina","NA","And yet not a single writer in this series notes a fundamental irony: Despite  the declining number of young men and women who express interest in attending a  single-sex college, thousands of these same women and men every year enter  co-educational institutions, then immediately set about segregating themselves:  from men- and women-only dorms to sports teams to fraternities and sororities.  Let's not fool ourselves. The experience of higher education in this country is  profoundly gendered, no matter how much some of these contributors would like  us to believe otherwise.","Years ago, during a classroom visit, I observed a small group of black and  Latino high school boys sitting at their desks looking into handheld mirrors.  They were tasked with answering the question, ""What do you see?"" One boy said,  ""I see an ugly face."" Another said, ""I see a big nose.""

It was one of the many moments I observed in single-sex schools where black and  Latino boys felt comfortable, and allowed, to express their emotions, changing  notions about a one dimensional image of masculinity. Our society is partly  responsible for the ways in which gender-based expectations can be reinforced  and, over time, those expectations can help create vulnerable situations that  lead to limited economic mobility, job opportunity and leadership development.

A benefit of single-sex environments is the opportunity for cognitive expansion  that can exist alongside multifaceted displays of masculinity and femininity.  In single-sex education, teachers make an understanding of race, ethnicity,  linguistic diversity, masculinity, femininity and sexuality a profound part of  their educational mission. Such identity-driven missions create protective  environments, like the ones found in single-sex high schools like Urban Prep  Academy and Eagle Academy, and colleges like Bryn Mawr, Spelman and Morehouse.

"Dd003.txt","Should Happy Hour Be Banned?","Some states ban happy hour deals for promoting excessive drinking and drunken driving. Should more do so?","Responsible Service Makes Sense, Happy Hour Bans Don't","#1","Karen","NA","I would love to see bartenders and owners police themselves rather than  institute a ban on happy hour prices for alcohol, but the problem is they  don't. I can't recall a time when I have ever seen a bartender or owner cut off  a customer, even on that was clearly intoxicated. What I experience is constant  inquiries as to whether I am ready for another, and sometimes urgings that I  am. I am pretty direct about my limits, and tell waiters and bartenders that  I'm a light-weight. Two is my limit, and anything more than that I become a  ""behavior problem."" I would be a driving, walking and biking problem as well.  Increasingly, I find that a second drink is probably ill-advised, especially if  I am going to drive. My recommendation is that communities hold bars and  restaurant legally accountable if drunk driving investigations included  rigorous prosecutions of establishments that over-serve alcohol, when sentences  that include bone-crushing fines and jail time. Bars and restaurants are  complicit in these crimes because they are knowingly encouraging high  consumption of alcohol for their own gain.","In the beginning of my career as a bartender, I worked in a solid establishment  with great food and beverages that offered a happy hour. I appreciated it  because it brought in clientele fairly early in the evening when bars are often  quiet.

During that hour, the average check was two drinks per person, and they  frequently would order an appetizer. After it was over, some guests stayed on  and ordered a meal. But more often than not, many of the guests made their way  home without much fanfare.

Yet, happy hour or not, the one thing that I was always diligent about was  serving water and frequently checking in with my guests to make sure that they  were in good shape. One of the owners was always on-premise and frequently  checked in at the bar to ensure all was going well. In general, offering food  and water and frequent check-in's with one's patrons is not just a good  preventative -- at the core, it's simply responsible hospitality.

At this point in my career as an bar owner, I can appreciate it for similar  reasons. From a financial perspective, bars can often be fairly quiet places  the first hour or two after opening. Now, when various states are considering a  minimum wage increase to $15 an hour, a short selection of drinks offered at a  slight discount can help to stimulate business and offset costs.

It's a bit narrowminded to think that a happy hour ban is going to drastically  reduce problems. An establishment that offers food can avoid happy hour  restrictions by leaving their drinks at full-price and discounting their food  instead. A guest can beat the system by simply patronizing a bar that offers  inexpensive drinks during all of its hours of operations.

We should instead be addressing this issue at the core with responsible  service. In lieu of happy hour bans, I'd like to see legislature that requires  all food and beverage establishments to annually certify all employees who  serve alcohol through an accredited alcohol management program. New hires  should be put through the program before they start.

During that hour, the average check was two drinks per person, and they  frequently would order an appetizer. After it was over, some guests stayed on  and ordered a meal. But more often than not, many of the guests made their way  home without much fanfare.

Yet, happy hour or not, the one thing that I was always diligent about was  serving water and frequently checking in with my guests to make sure that they  were in good shape. One of the owners was always on-premise and frequently  checked in at the bar to ensure all was going well. In general, offering food  and water and frequent check-in's with one's patrons is not just a good  preventative -- at the core, it's simply responsible hospitality.

At this point in my career as an bar owner, I can appreciate it for similar  reasons. From a financial perspective, bars can often be fairly quiet places  the first hour or two after opening. Now, when various states are considering a  minimum wage increase to $15 an hour, a short selection of drinks offered at a  slight discount can help to stimulate business and offset costs.

It's a bit narrowminded to think that a happy hour ban is going to drastically  reduce problems. An establishment that offers food can avoid happy hour  restrictions by leaving their drinks at full-price and discounting their food  instead. A guest can beat the system by simply patronizing a bar that offers  inexpensive drinks during all of its hours of operations.

We should instead be addressing this issue at the core with responsible  service. In lieu of happy hour bans, I'd like to see legislature that requires  all food and beverage establishments to annually certify all employees who  serve alcohol through an accredited alcohol management program. New hires  should be put through the program before they start.

I've participated in a number of such certifications, and I require that my  entire staff be certified. Every establishment has an obligation to ensure the  safety of its guests at all times -- not solely during happy hour.","4","Yet , happy hour or not , the one thing that I was always diligent about was serving water and frequently checking in with my guests to make sure that they were in good shape .","One of the owners was always on-premise and frequently checked in at the bar to ensure all was going well .","In general , offering food and water and frequent check-in 's with one 's patrons is not just a good preventative -- at the core , it 's simply responsible hospitality ."

How soon we all forget!","In the beginning of my career as a bartender, I worked in a solid establishment  with great food and beverages that offered a happy hour. I appreciated it  because it brought in clientele fairly early in the evening when bars are often  quiet.

During that hour, the average check was two drinks per person, and they  frequently would order an appetizer. After it was over, some guests stayed on  and ordered a meal. But more often than not, many of the guests made their way  home without much fanfare.

Yet, happy hour or not, the one thing that I was always diligent about was  serving water and frequently checking in with my guests to make sure that they  were in good shape. One of the owners was always on-premise and frequently  checked in at the bar to ensure all was going well. In general, offering food  and water and frequent check-in's with one's patrons is not just a good  preventative -- at the core, it's simply responsible hospitality.

At this point in my career as an bar owner, I can appreciate it for similar  reasons. From a financial perspective, bars can often be fairly quiet places  the first hour or two after opening. Now, when various states are considering a  minimum wage increase to $15 an hour, a short selection of drinks offered at a  slight discount can help to stimulate business and offset costs.

It's a bit narrowminded to think that a happy hour ban is going to drastically  reduce problems. An establishment that offers food can avoid happy hour  restrictions by leaving their drinks at full-price and discounting their food  instead. A guest can beat the system by simply patronizing a bar that offers  inexpensive drinks during all of its hours of operations.

We should instead be addressing this issue at the core with responsible  service. In lieu of happy hour bans, I'd like to see legislature that requires  all food and beverage establishments to annually certify all employees who  serve alcohol through an accredited alcohol management program. New hires  should be put through the program before they start.

I've participated in a number of such certifications, and I require that my  entire staff be certified. Every establishment has an obligation to ensure the  safety of its guests at all times -- not solely during happy hour.","1"," Responsible Service Makes Sense , Happy Hour Bans ` t ."

It's a bit narrowminded to think that a happy hour ban is going to drastically  reduce problems. An establishment that offers food can avoid happy hour  restrictions by leaving their drinks at full-price and discounting their food  instead. A guest can beat the system by simply patronizing a bar that offers  inexpensive drinks during all of its hours of operations.

In lieu of happy hour bans, I'd like to see legislature that requires  all food and beverage establishments to annually certify all employees who  serve alcohol through an accredited alcohol management program.

I appreciated it  because it brought in clientele fairly early in the evening when bars are often  quiet.

During that hour, the average check was two drinks per person, and they  frequently would order an appetizer. After it was over, some guests stayed on  and ordered a meal. But more often than not, many of the guests made their way  home without much fanfare.

Yet, happy hour or not, the one thing that I was always diligent about was  serving water and frequently checking in with my guests to make sure that they  were in good shape. One of the owners was always on-premise and frequently  checked in at the bar to ensure all was going well. In general, offering food  and water and frequent check-in's with one's patrons is not just a good  preventative -- at the core, it's simply responsible hospitality.

At this point in my career as an bar owner, I can appreciate it for similar  reasons. From a financial perspective, bars can often be fairly quiet places  the first hour or two after opening. Now, when various states are considering a  minimum wage increase to $15 an hour, a short selection of drinks offered at a  slight discount can help to stimulate business and offset costs.

It's a bit narrowminded to think that a happy hour ban is going to drastically  reduce problems. An establishment that offers food can avoid happy hour  restrictions by leaving their drinks at full-price and discounting their food  instead. A guest can beat the system by simply patronizing a bar that offers  inexpensive drinks during all of its hours of operations.

We should instead be addressing this issue at the core with responsible  service. In lieu of happy hour bans, I'd like to see legislature that requires  all food and beverage establishments to annually certify all employees who  serve alcohol through an accredited alcohol management program.

These things aren't going to  happen of course, which is the point.","In the beginning of my career as a bartender, I worked in a solid establishment  with great food and beverages that offered a happy hour. I appreciated it  because it brought in clientele fairly early in the evening when bars are often  quiet.

During that hour, the average check was two drinks per person, and they  frequently would order an appetizer. After it was over, some guests stayed on  and ordered a meal. But more often than not, many of the guests made their way  home without much fanfare.

Yet, happy hour or not, the one thing that I was always diligent about was  serving water and frequently checking in with my guests to make sure that they  were in good shape. One of the owners was always on-premise and frequently  checked in at the bar to ensure all was going well. In general, offering food  and water and frequent check-in's with one's patrons is not just a good  preventative -- at the core, it's simply responsible hospitality.

At this point in my career as an bar owner, I can appreciate it for similar  reasons. From a financial perspective, bars can often be fairly quiet places  the first hour or two after opening. Now, when various states are considering a  minimum wage increase to $15 an hour, a short selection of drinks offered at a  slight discount can help to stimulate business and offset costs.

It's a bit narrowminded to think that a happy hour ban is going to drastically  reduce problems. An establishment that offers food can avoid happy hour  restrictions by leaving their drinks at full-price and discounting their food  instead. A guest can beat the system by simply patronizing a bar that offers  inexpensive drinks during all of its hours of operations.

We should instead be addressing this issue at the core with responsible  service. In lieu of happy hour bans, I'd like to see legislature that requires  all food and beverage establishments to annually certify all employees who  serve alcohol through an accredited alcohol management program.

Happy hours were banned in Illinois in 1989 for good reason: Happy hour  discounts encouraged excessive drinking during a short period of time. People  were getting drunk off cheap drinks, driving drunk and causing harm (and  sometimes death) to themselves and others.

When I wrote about my opposition to happy hours on my Facebook page last week,  a friend told me of the tragic death of her close friend, a freshman at Eastern  Illinois University, who was on her way home for Thanksgiving break in 1987  when the car she was riding in was hit by a driver who had just left a happy  hour.

Right. Forget about the Art Institute. Forget about the Museum of Science and  Industry, the Shedd Aquarium, Navy Pier, great food, the Cubs, the Sox, Stanley  Cup champion Blackhawks, the Bears, the Magnificent Mile, Lakefront Trail, the  parks, the blues and jazz, etc., etc. Only cheap drinks at happy hour lure the  big spenders to the Windy City!

Last time I listened to Frank Sinatra's ""Chicago,"" there was no mention of  cheap happy hour drinks. And, frankly, people are more likely to come to  Chicago to see that man who danced with his wife than they are to come here to  binge cheaply at happy hour.

Chicago toddles for reasons that have nothing to do with $1 drinks between 5  and 7.

The competition will not be between Chicago and San Francisco and Miami for  tourist dollars but between watering holes seeking to out-happy hour each other  by offering the most intoxicating drink offers, as it was in the halcyon days  of Chicago happy hour.

According to the United States Department of Transportation, there were 393  alcohol-related traffic fatalities in Illinois in 2012 - a year in which happy  hour was outlawed in Illinois.

According to the United States Department of Transportation, there were 393  alcohol-related traffic fatalities in Illinois in 2012 - a year in which happy  hour was outlawed in Illinois.

Last time I listened to Frank Sinatra's ""Chicago,"" there was no mention of  cheap happy hour drinks. And, frankly, people are more likely to come to  Chicago to see that man who danced with his wife than they are to come here to  binge cheaply at happy hour.

The competition will not be between Chicago and San Francisco and Miami for  tourist dollars but between watering holes seeking to out-happy hour each other  by offering the most intoxicating drink offers, as it was in the halcyon days  of Chicago happy hour.

According to the United States Department of Transportation, there were 393  alcohol-related traffic fatalities in Illinois in 2012 - a year in which happy  hour was outlawed in Illinois. Suffice it to say that the reinstitution of  happy hour, with its drunken hordes stumbling forth onto Illinois' roads, is  not likely to make Illinois' roads safer.

Happy hours were banned in Illinois in 1989 for good reason: Happy hour  discounts encouraged excessive drinking during a short period of time. People  were getting drunk off cheap drinks, driving drunk and causing harm (and  sometimes death) to themselves and others.

When I wrote about my opposition to happy hours on my Facebook page last week,  a friend told me of the tragic death of her close friend, a freshman at Eastern  Illinois University, who was on her way home for Thanksgiving break in 1987  when the car she was riding in was hit by a driver who had just left a happy  hour.

Last time I listened to Frank Sinatra's ""Chicago,"" there was no mention of  cheap happy hour drinks. And, frankly, people are more likely to come to  Chicago to see that man who danced with his wife than they are to come here to  binge cheaply at happy hour.

Chicago toddles for reasons that have nothing to do with $1 drinks between 5  and 7.

The competition will not be between Chicago and San Francisco and Miami for  tourist dollars but between watering holes seeking to out-happy hour each other  by offering the most intoxicating drink offers, as it was in the halcyon days  of Chicago happy hour.

According to the United States Department of Transportation, there were 393  alcohol-related traffic fatalities in Illinois in 2012 - a year in which happy  hour was outlawed in Illinois. Suffice it to say that the reinstitution of  happy hour, with its drunken hordes stumbling forth onto Illinois' roads, is  not likely to make Illinois' roads safer.

When I wrote about my opposition to happy hours on my Facebook page last week,  a friend told me of the tragic death of her close friend, a freshman at Eastern  Illinois University, who was on her way home for Thanksgiving break in 1987  when the car she was riding in was hit by a driver who had just left a happy  hour.

Supporters of the bill say it will let Chicago compete with other cities for  tourist dollars. But will tourists flock to Chicago because they can drink more  for less at happy hour?

Right. Forget about the Art Institute. Forget about the Museum of Science and  Industry, the Shedd Aquarium, Navy Pier, great food, the Cubs, the Sox, Stanley  Cup champion Blackhawks, the Bears, the Magnificent Mile, Lakefront Trail, the  parks, the blues and jazz, etc., etc. Only cheap drinks at happy hour lure the  big spenders to the Windy City!

Last time I listened to Frank Sinatra's ""Chicago,"" there was no mention of  cheap happy hour drinks. And, frankly, people are more likely to come to  Chicago to see that man who danced with his wife than they are to come here to  binge cheaply at happy hour.

Chicago toddles for reasons that have nothing to do with $1 drinks between 5  and 7.

The competition will not be between Chicago and San Francisco and Miami for  tourist dollars but between watering holes seeking to out-happy hour each other  by offering the most intoxicating drink offers, as it was in the halcyon days  of Chicago happy hour.

According to the United States Department of Transportation, there were 393  alcohol-related traffic fatalities in Illinois in 2012 - a year in which happy  hour was outlawed in Illinois. Suffice it to say that the reinstitution of  happy hour, with its drunken hordes stumbling forth onto Illinois' roads, is  not likely to make Illinois' roads safer.

Happy hours were banned in Illinois in 1989 for good reason: Happy hour  discounts encouraged excessive drinking during a short period of time. People  were getting drunk off cheap drinks, driving drunk and causing harm (and  sometimes death) to themselves and others.

When I wrote about my opposition to happy hours on my Facebook page last week,  a friend told me of the tragic death of her close friend, a freshman at Eastern  Illinois University, who was on her way home for Thanksgiving break in 1987  when the car she was riding in was hit by a driver who had just left a happy  hour.

Even then I knew that personal  freedom came with a price.

But in my inner city public high school clinic, the price of a far more  important form of freedom was heavily discounted. At 15, I got my first  prescription for birth control, courtesy of the State of California. The nurse  handed me a colorful pamphlet that outlined an array of options: the pill, the  plastic insert, NuvaRing, etc. I opted for the pill and headed back to class.  It wasn't long after seeing two girls in my grade become pregnant and drop out  that I realized I was given much more than a few options of birth control, but  many options regarding how I wanted my future to look.

My belief that the government should provide free, on-demand birth control is  deeply rooted in my belief that the primary role of any government is to  protect and expand personal liberties. But on a much simpler level, it makes  economic sense.

If our government wishes to shrink its welfare state, providing free birth  control to poor young women should be the place to start. According to  Brookings Institution, 72.6 percent of pregnancies of unmarried women under 30  are unintended. When these women cannot shoulder the financial strain of  raising children they turn to state aid for food, shelter and education.

Giving poor young women easy access to birth control is about exactly that -  control. Many poor girls grow up believing their destinies have already been  fashioned by forces beyond their control. Contraception gives young women the  freedom to say, ""I'm not ready to be a mother, and I don't have to be. I have  options."" Access to affordable health care is a government issue. Protection of  personal freedom is a government issue. And while providing health care and  protecting civil liberties may seem costly, asking young women to sacrifice  either comes at a much greater price.","3","But in my inner city public high school clinic , the price of a far more important form of freedom was heavily discounted .","At 15 , I got my first prescription for birth control , courtesy of the State of California .","The nurse handed me a colorful pamphlet that outlined an array of options : the pill , the plastic insert , NuvaRing , etc .","I opted for the pill and headed back to class .","It wasn' t long after seeing two girls in my grade become pregnant and drop out that I realized I was given much more than a few options of birth control , but many options regarding how I wanted my future to look ."

Having access to the full range of contraceptive methods, including highly  effective long-acting methods, and the information needed to choose the method  that best fits a woman's life is key to achieving planned, healthier  pregnancies. But cost can be a significant barrier for many women to obtain the  birth control method of her choice. That's why federal and state investments in  publicly supported family planning services are so crucial.

The enormous benefit of these investments is well documented: Guttmacher  Institute research shows that in 2010, publicly funded family planning services  helped women to avoid 2.2 million unintended pregnancies. These unintended  pregnancies, in turn, would have resulted in 1.1 million unintended births and  760,000 abortions.

Further, while publicly supported family planning services enable low-income  women to have healthier pregnancies and achieve their life goals, they also  yield considerable dividends for taxpayers. In 2010, these services resulted in  a net savings to the federal and state governments of $13.6 billion - $7 for  every public dollar spent.

About half of these impressive gains come from family planning centers  supported by the Title X national family planning program, the linchpin of the  U.S. family planning effort. Without the services provided by these centers in  2012, the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States  would be 32 percent higher.

Healthier pregnancies, a steep reduction in need for abortion and significant  fiscal savings - policymakers of all stripes should line up to support such a  hugely successful program, and for decades they had. Unfortunately, social  conservatives in the U.S. Congress are putting ideology over evidence, with the  House voting to eliminate Title X entirely and the Senate proposing deep cuts  to the program.

Doing so is deeply irresponsible and, ultimately, self-defeating. Policy makers  should instead respect Americans' wishes by protecting contraceptive access.  That means adequately funding Title X and implementing the Affordable Care  Act's Medicaid expansion in all states.

That means adequately funding Title X and implementing the Affordable Care  Act's Medicaid expansion in all states.

Tens of millions of people in the United States rely on contraception to  achieve their childbearing goals.

"Dd006.txt","Birth Control on Demand","Should it be provided by the government to reduce teen pregnancies?","Publicly Funded Birth Control Is Crucial","#2","AACNY","NA","When 40% of women don't use the birth control they already own and which has  already been paid for, there is more to the problem than ""access"" and ""cost"".  These are often mistakenly identified as the sole causes of unintended  pregnancies. No wonder the problem persists. <br/>If you really wanted to help women, you don't demand solutions that don't  address their problem but, instead, look honestly at their problem and go from  there. It is *using* birth control not gaining access to it. <br/>Funding solutions to the wrong problem doesn't actually help women. We should  fund solutions but methods that actually work. Long-term birth control has  promise. It should be investigated as a potential solution. Money from other  ineffective methods -- ex., that require daily action -- should be redirected  there.","All women should have the means to make fundamental choices about whether and  when to have children. That is why the public investment in family planning  that enables young and low-income women to plan their own pregnancies is smart  government at its best. It leads to healthier mothers and babies, empowers  women to finish their education or job training, and saves billions in taxpayer  dollars.

Having access to the full range of contraceptive methods, including highly  effective long-acting methods, and the information needed to choose the method  that best fits a woman's life is key to achieving planned, healthier  pregnancies. But cost can be a significant barrier for many women to obtain the  birth control method of her choice. That's why federal and state investments in  publicly supported family planning services are so crucial.

The enormous benefit of these investments is well documented: Guttmacher  Institute research shows that in 2010, publicly funded family planning services  helped women to avoid 2.2 million unintended pregnancies. These unintended  pregnancies, in turn, would have resulted in 1.1 million unintended births and  760,000 abortions.

Further, while publicly supported family planning services enable low-income  women to have healthier pregnancies and achieve their life goals, they also  yield considerable dividends for taxpayers. In 2010, these services resulted in  a net savings to the federal and state governments of $13.6 billion - $7 for  every public dollar spent.

About half of these impressive gains come from family planning centers  supported by the Title X national family planning program, the linchpin of the  U.S. family planning effort.

I'm pro-choice but I have a hard time believing  people getting pregnant just for the purpose of having an abortion. Yea people  changed their minds down the road, but perhaps we should discourage such poor  planning by penalizing with a tax; not a ban..but a tax to show disapproval  towards such poor decision making while raising funds for birth control.","All women should have the means to make fundamental choices about whether and  when to have children. That is why the public investment in family planning  that enables young and low-income women to plan their own pregnancies is smart  government at its best. It leads to healthier mothers and babies, empowers  women to finish their education or job training, and saves billions in taxpayer  dollars.

Having access to the full range of contraceptive methods, including highly  effective long-acting methods, and the information needed to choose the method  that best fits a woman's life is key to achieving planned, healthier  pregnancies. But cost can be a significant barrier for many women to obtain the  birth control method of her choice. That's why federal and state investments in  publicly supported family planning services are so crucial.

The enormous benefit of these investments is well documented: Guttmacher  Institute research shows that in 2010, publicly funded family planning services  helped women to avoid 2.2 million unintended pregnancies. These unintended  pregnancies, in turn, would have resulted in 1.1 million unintended births and  760,000 abortions.

Further, while publicly supported family planning services enable low-income  women to have healthier pregnancies and achieve their life goals, they also  yield considerable dividends for taxpayers. In 2010, these services resulted in  a net savings to the federal and state governments of $13.6 billion - $7 for  every public dollar spent.

About half of these impressive gains come from family planning centers  supported by the Title X national family planning program, the linchpin of the  U.S. family planning effort. Without the services provided by these centers in  2012, the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States  would be 32 percent higher.

Healthier pregnancies, a steep reduction in need for abortion and significant  fiscal savings - policymakers of all stripes should line up to support such a  hugely successful program, and for decades they had. Unfortunately, social  conservatives in the U.S. Congress are putting ideology over evidence, with the  House voting to eliminate Title X entirely and the Senate proposing deep cuts  to the program.

Doing so is deeply irresponsible and, ultimately, self-defeating. Policy makers  should instead respect Americans' wishes by protecting contraceptive access.  That means adequately funding Title X and implementing the Affordable Care  Act's Medicaid expansion in all states. Policymakers should not erect new  barriers that raise the cost of birth control or otherwise interfere with a  woman's ability to use the contraceptive method that is right for her.

Healthier pregnancies, a steep reduction in need for abortion and significant  fiscal savings - policymakers of all stripes should line up to support such a  hugely successful program, and for decades they had. Unfortunately, social  conservatives in the U.S. Congress are putting ideology over evidence, with the  House voting to eliminate Title X entirely and the Senate proposing deep cuts  to the program.

Doing so is deeply irresponsible and, ultimately, self-defeating. Policy makers  should instead respect Americans' wishes by protecting contraceptive access.  That means adequately funding Title X and implementing the Affordable Care  Act's Medicaid expansion in all states. Policymakers should not erect new  barriers that raise the cost of birth control or otherwise interfere with a  woman's ability to use the contraceptive method that is right for her.

Tens of millions of people in the United States rely on contraception to  achieve their childbearing goals. Let's make sure the ability to prevent  unwanted pregnancies and space wanted ones is available to all who want it,  regardless of their income.","8","Doing so is deeply irresponsible and , ultimately , self-defeating .","Policy makers should instead respect Americans ' wishes by protecting contraceptive access .","That means adequately funding Title X and implementing the Affordable Care Act 's Medicaid expansion in all states .","Policymakers should not erect new barriers that raise the cost of birth control or otherwise interfere with a woman 's ability to use the contraceptive method that is right for her ."

In 2010, these services resulted in  a net savings to the federal and state governments of $13.6 billion - $7 for  every public dollar spent.

About half of these impressive gains come from family planning centers  supported by the Title X national family planning program, the linchpin of the  U.S. family planning effort. Without the services provided by these centers in  2012, the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States  would be 32 percent higher.

Healthier pregnancies, a steep reduction in need for abortion and significant  fiscal savings - policymakers of all stripes should line up to support such a  hugely successful program, and for decades they had. Unfortunately, social  conservatives in the U.S. Congress are putting ideology over evidence, with the  House voting to eliminate Title X entirely and the Senate proposing deep cuts  to the program.

Doing so is deeply irresponsible and, ultimately, self-defeating. Policy makers  should instead respect Americans' wishes by protecting contraceptive access.  That means adequately funding Title X and implementing the Affordable Care  Act's Medicaid expansion in all states. Policymakers should not erect new  barriers that raise the cost of birth control or otherwise interfere with a  woman's ability to use the contraceptive method that is right for her.

In 2010, these services resulted in  a net savings to the federal and state governments of $13.6 billion - $7 for  every public dollar spent.

About half of these impressive gains come from family planning centers  supported by the Title X national family planning program, the linchpin of the  U.S. family planning effort.

Of course, we wouldn't want them  to forsake their schoolwork or personal relationships, but would we call that  kind of drive and focus an ""addiction""?","5","But scholars are beginning to make distinctions between screen time that interferes with functioning , and that which leads to more positive engagement .","With respect to problematic video game playing , for example , those who might be considered `` addicted '' include only about 3 to 5 percent of adolescents .","By contrast , video game playing , regardless of type , has also been linked to creativity in middle school students ."
"Dd008.txt","Teens Hooked on Screens","Is Internet addiction a concern for teenagers?","Don't Limit Your Teen's Screen Time","#1","Destiny","NA","When I was younger my mother monitored my screen time and whenever I got the  chance and she wasn't around I would constantly be on my phone and/or computer.  So yes, parents having to monitor your screen time will affect how much you're  online negativity because you want to be on it every second. But with my  sisters now she lets them do whatever they want and be online constantly so  they only go online when they need to or if they're bored but if not they're  playing outside or with dolls.","Some children grow up wanting to play baseball all day, but I wanted to play  Castlevania and Super Mario Brothers. Sadly, my parents believed I'd fry my  brain for the love of videogames, so I was limited to an hour of screen time  before dinner.

But that only fueled covert binging. Every time I was at a friend's house, we'd  spend the whole time glued to the Nintendo system. When I was at family  reunions, my cousins and I would fight over who got to play next, and when my  parents went out of town, it was a no-sleep videogame free-for-all.

I look back on those years and wonder why my parents thought that videogames  were hurtful to my youth. They taught me how to tell stories, create worlds and  even how to save and spend money. Videogames were my first real exposure to  programming, and they helped me realize my career in technology.

Regardless, we are in a different era. Today, technology is so prevalent, it's  hard to keep it away from children and teenagers. But I don't think we should  even try. If we restrict our kids' access, while we're emailing from an Apple  Watch, they won't respect the rules when they have a chance to get around them.

As an experiment, I stopped restricting my children's screen time in my house,  and immediately saw results at a recent family reunion. My nephew lives in a  strict, screen-regulated home. So, a trip to Grandma's - where there are no  restrictions or parental controls - means unlimited SpongeBob. While my kids  were out playing with their cousins in the backyard, my nephew was locked on  the TV for the entire evening. This wasn't an opportunity for my kids to binge  on tech because they couldn't otherwise - they were more excited to spend time  with cousins they never see.

Of course, kids will still binge. Adults binge. Netflix has built an entire  viewing model around binging. But allowing children and teens to regulate their  behavior like adults gives them room to naturally modify their own habits.

Plus, many kids do learn social and technical skills through screen time, even  more so now then when I was growing up. For example, the vast majority of  digital gaming today is a social event: Our kids are growing relationships  online that often blossom into lifelong friendships. (Anecdotally, I met many  of my friends through online games and even saw two - a couple who met through  a World of Warcraft raid - end up happily married.)

Technology is not going away or becoming less popular. We should let our  teenagers build on MineCraft, mess around in Photoshop, and make music in  GarageBand. Eliminating screen time is a thing of the past, and if we want to  stay technically savvy through our 60s, our kids will be the ones to teach us  all the new tricks.","4","I look back on those years and wonder why my parents thought that videogames were hurtful to my youth .","They taught me how to tell stories , create worlds and even how to save and spend money .","Videogames were my first real exposure to programming , and they helped me realize my career in technology ."

It is already beyond  our imagination. As the author points out, children tend to be caught up in  videogames or technology, which sometimes works out for their future. However,  obsessing on the internet can limit their real life. In my country, children  tend to stay at home and play games or watch the internet rather than going out  with friends. They can learn how to communicate with people on the internet but  it's hard to live in real life. So, I think parents limiting children's screen  time and let them go and learn many things in society can help children's  future.","Some children grow up wanting to play baseball all day, but I wanted to play  Castlevania and Super Mario Brothers. Sadly, my parents believed I'd fry my  brain for the love of videogames, so I was limited to an hour of screen time  before dinner.

But that only fueled covert binging. Every time I was at a friend's house, we'd  spend the whole time glued to the Nintendo system. When I was at family  reunions, my cousins and I would fight over who got to play next, and when my  parents went out of town, it was a no-sleep videogame free-for-all.

I look back on those years and wonder why my parents thought that videogames  were hurtful to my youth. They taught me how to tell stories, create worlds and  even how to save and spend money. Videogames were my first real exposure to  programming, and they helped me realize my career in technology.

Regardless, we are in a different era. Today, technology is so prevalent, it's  hard to keep it away from children and teenagers. But I don't think we should  even try. If we restrict our kids' access, while we're emailing from an Apple  Watch, they won't respect the rules when they have a chance to get around them.

As an experiment, I stopped restricting my children's screen time in my house,  and immediately saw results at a recent family reunion. My nephew lives in a  strict, screen-regulated home. So, a trip to Grandma's - where there are no  restrictions or parental controls - means unlimited SpongeBob. While my kids  were out playing with their cousins in the backyard, my nephew was locked on  the TV for the entire evening. This wasn't an opportunity for my kids to binge  on tech because they couldn't otherwise - they were more excited to spend time  with cousins they never see.

Of course, kids will still binge. Adults binge. Netflix has built an entire  viewing model around binging. But allowing children and teens to regulate their  behavior like adults gives them room to naturally modify their own habits.

Plus, many kids do learn social and technical skills through screen time, even  more so now then when I was growing up. For example, the vast majority of  digital gaming today is a social event: Our kids are growing relationships  online that often blossom into lifelong friendships. (Anecdotally, I met many  of my friends through online games and even saw two - a couple who met through  a World of Warcraft raid - end up happily married.)

Technology is not going away or becoming less popular. We should let our  teenagers build on MineCraft, mess around in Photoshop, and make music in  GarageBand.

Videogames were my first real exposure to  programming, and they helped me realize my career in technology.

If we restrict our kids' access, while we're emailing from an Apple  Watch, they won't respect the rules when they have a chance to get around them.

As an experiment, I stopped restricting my children's screen time in my house,  and immediately saw results at a recent family reunion. My nephew lives in a  strict, screen-regulated home.

I think restriction of their behaviors could be more harmful to  children. When I was a teen, my action was limited by my older sister. She took  care of me like mom but she was a very conservative person. As much as her  worry about me, she limited me much more and made strong rules. One of example  is that she limited my fashion style. I had to wear student look and simple  clothing. But I wore whatever I want when my sister was out of sight. When I  think about that time, it was not good memories for me. I felt that I lost my  freedom from her. From my experience, parent shouldn't control their children.  If parent lead their child with some advises, parent will get good expectation  from their children. And, my sister used to say that ""Are you going to be  stupid?"" when I watched on TV. I don't really disagree that. I could get and  learn many information from the screen time. I really support your argument  that technology is not harmful to children and to regulate their behavior like  adults.","Some children grow up wanting to play baseball all day, but I wanted to play  Castlevania and Super Mario Brothers. Sadly, my parents believed I'd fry my  brain for the love of videogames, so I was limited to an hour of screen time  before dinner.

But that only fueled covert binging. Every time I was at a friend's house, we'd  spend the whole time glued to the Nintendo system. When I was at family  reunions, my cousins and I would fight over who got to play next, and when my  parents went out of town, it was a no-sleep videogame free-for-all.

I look back on those years and wonder why my parents thought that videogames  were hurtful to my youth. They taught me how to tell stories, create worlds and  even how to save and spend money. Videogames were my first real exposure to  programming, and they helped me realize my career in technology.

Regardless, we are in a different era. Today, technology is so prevalent, it's  hard to keep it away from children and teenagers. But I don't think we should  even try. If we restrict our kids' access, while we're emailing from an Apple  Watch, they won't respect the rules when they have a chance to get around them.

As an experiment, I stopped restricting my children's screen time in my house,  and immediately saw results at a recent family reunion. My nephew lives in a  strict, screen-regulated home. So, a trip to Grandma's - where there are no  restrictions or parental controls - means unlimited SpongeBob. While my kids  were out playing with their cousins in the backyard, my nephew was locked on  the TV for the entire evening.

Sadly, my parents believed I'd fry my  brain for the love of videogames, so I was limited to an hour of screen time  before dinner.

But that only fueled covert binging. Every time I was at a friend's house, we'd  spend the whole time glued to the Nintendo system. When I was at family  reunions, my cousins and I would fight over who got to play next, and when my  parents went out of town, it was a no-sleep videogame free-for-all.

I look back on those years and wonder why my parents thought that videogames  were hurtful to my youth. They taught me how to tell stories, create worlds and  even how to save and spend money. Videogames were my first real exposure to  programming, and they helped me realize my career in technology.

Regardless, we are in a different era. Today, technology is so prevalent, it's  hard to keep it away from children and teenagers. But I don't think we should  even try. If we restrict our kids' access, while we're emailing from an Apple  Watch, they won't respect the rules when they have a chance to get around them.

As an experiment, I stopped restricting my children's screen time in my house,  and immediately saw results at a recent family reunion. My nephew lives in a  strict, screen-regulated home. So, a trip to Grandma's - where there are no  restrictions or parental controls - means unlimited SpongeBob. While my kids  were out playing with their cousins in the backyard, my nephew was locked on  the TV for the entire evening. This wasn't an opportunity for my kids to binge  on tech because they couldn't otherwise - they were more excited to spend time  with cousins they never see.

Of course, kids will still binge. Adults binge. Netflix has built an entire  viewing model around binging. But allowing children and teens to regulate their  behavior like adults gives them room to naturally modify their own habits.

Plus, many kids do learn social and technical skills through screen time, even  more so now then when I was growing up.

I look back on those years and wonder why my parents thought that videogames  were hurtful to my youth. They taught me how to tell stories, create worlds and  even how to save and spend money. Videogames were my first real exposure to  programming, and they helped me realize my career in technology.

Regardless, we are in a different era. Today, technology is so prevalent, it's  hard to keep it away from children and teenagers. But I don't think we should  even try. If we restrict our kids' access, while we're emailing from an Apple  Watch, they won't respect the rules when they have a chance to get around them.

As an experiment, I stopped restricting my children's screen time in my house,  and immediately saw results at a recent family reunion. My nephew lives in a  strict, screen-regulated home. So, a trip to Grandma's - where there are no  restrictions or parental controls - means unlimited SpongeBob. While my kids  were out playing with their cousins in the backyard, my nephew was locked on  the TV for the entire evening. This wasn't an opportunity for my kids to binge  on tech because they couldn't otherwise - they were more excited to spend time  with cousins they never see.

Of course, kids will still binge. Adults binge. Netflix has built an entire  viewing model around binging. But allowing children and teens to regulate their  behavior like adults gives them room to naturally modify their own habits.

Plus, many kids do learn social and technical skills through screen time, even  more so now then when I was growing up. For example, the vast majority of  digital gaming today is a social event: Our kids are growing relationships  online that often blossom into lifelong friendships. (Anecdotally, I met many  of my friends through online games and even saw two - a couple who met through  a World of Warcraft raid - end up happily married.)

Technology is not going away or becoming less popular. We should let our  teenagers build on MineCraft, mess around in Photoshop, and make music in  GarageBand.

But that only fueled covert binging. Every time I was at a friend's house, we'd  spend the whole time glued to the Nintendo system. When I was at family  reunions, my cousins and I would fight over who got to play next, and when my  parents went out of town, it was a no-sleep videogame free-for-all.

I look back on those years and wonder why my parents thought that videogames  were hurtful to my youth. They taught me how to tell stories, create worlds and  even how to save and spend money. Videogames were my first real exposure to  programming, and they helped me realize my career in technology.

Regardless, we are in a different era. Today, technology is so prevalent, it's  hard to keep it away from children and teenagers. But I don't think we should  even try. If we restrict our kids' access, while we're emailing from an Apple  Watch, they won't respect the rules when they have a chance to get around them.

As an experiment, I stopped restricting my children's screen time in my house,  and immediately saw results at a recent family reunion. My nephew lives in a  strict, screen-regulated home. So, a trip to Grandma's - where there are no  restrictions or parental controls - means unlimited SpongeBob. While my kids  were out playing with their cousins in the backyard, my nephew was locked on  the TV for the entire evening. This wasn't an opportunity for my kids to binge  on tech because they couldn't otherwise - they were more excited to spend time  with cousins they never see.

Of course, kids will still binge. Adults binge. Netflix has built an entire  viewing model around binging. But allowing children and teens to regulate their  behavior like adults gives them room to naturally modify their own habits.

Plus, many kids do learn social and technical skills through screen time, even  more so now then when I was growing up. For example, the vast majority of  digital gaming today is a social event: Our kids are growing relationships  online that often blossom into lifelong friendships. (Anecdotally, I met many  of my friends through online games and even saw two - a couple who met through  a World of Warcraft raid - end up happily married.)

Technology is not going away or becoming less popular. We should let our  teenagers build on MineCraft, mess around in Photoshop, and make music in  GarageBand. Eliminating screen time is a thing of the past, and if we want to  stay technically savvy through our 60s, our kids will be the ones to teach us  all the new tricks.","5","Regardless , we are in a different era .","Today , technology is so prevalent , it 's hard to keep it away from children and teenagers .","But I don' t think we should even try .","If we restrict our kids ' access , while we 're emailing from an Apple Watch , they won' t respect the rules when they have a chance to get around them ."

While my kids  were out playing with their cousins in the backyard, my nephew was locked on  the TV for the entire evening. This wasn't an opportunity for my kids to binge  on tech because they couldn't otherwise - they were more excited to spend time  with cousins they never see.

Of course, kids will still binge. Adults binge. Netflix has built an entire  viewing model around binging. But allowing children and teens to regulate their  behavior like adults gives them room to naturally modify their own habits.

Plus, many kids do learn social and technical skills through screen time, even  more so now then when I was growing up. For example, the vast majority of  digital gaming today is a social event: Our kids are growing relationships  online that often blossom into lifelong friendships. (Anecdotally, I met many  of my friends through online games and even saw two - a couple who met through  a World of Warcraft raid - end up happily married.)

Technology is not going away or becoming less popular. We should let our  teenagers build on MineCraft, mess around in Photoshop, and make music in  GarageBand. Eliminating screen time is a thing of the past, and if we want to  stay technically savvy through our 60s, our kids will be the ones to teach us  all the new tricks.","8","Plus , many kids do learn social and technical skills through screen time , even more so now then when I was growing up .","For example , the vast majority of digital gaming today is a social event : Our kids are growing relationships online that often blossom into lifelong friendships.
