To do otherwise is xenophobia.","It is no secret that many public school systems struggle to find adequate  resources to teach students who are behind grade level, some of whom have  significant other challenges in their home lives.

Undocumented children, especially those who come in at middle and high school  levels, often fall under this umbrella: They are usually at least two grade  levels behind, but assessing their skills is difficult because they have few if  any records. (The language barrier, in many cases, may keep children who are  more proficient in the content, but not English, from being in the appropriate  class level.) Often, immigrant children have experienced difficulty or trauma,  and they come to school with high levels of anxiety and fear.

In Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, where I was superintendent from 2011 to January  of this year, we had a major influx of Central American students last school  year. More than a thousand new children were enrolled last fall, and by  February 2014 we had the highest concentration of students with limited English  proficiency (around 10 percent of the students) of any public-school system in  the state.

This is not to say that immigrants, authorized or not, shouldn't be in the  school system. When it comes to our educational mission and duty, the passion  and commitment is there, so it is important to try to separate schooling from  politics. But better federal and monetary assistance is needed.

First, it is a bureaucratic challenge to assess the needs of immigrant  children, many of whom have unusual family structures, especially without  hiring more Spanish-speaking teachers and bilingual paraprofessionals. We need  extra classrooms, extra teachers and counselors, and money for transportation  costs and extended year programs to accelerate instruction that will bring  students to grade level.

Second, we need to help immigrant children who are behind learn faster. Some of  the undocumented students need a similar level of attention as special-needs  students, or their chances of dropping out soar. (This brings another societal  cost as those who cannot find identification in schools, and have few family  members nearby, have limited job opportunities and become prime candidates for  gangs.)

Third, we want an open and accepting culture at school for all our students,  but resentment can build when limited resources are spent on undocumented  children. The scarcity of funds can put up a significant social barrier to  acceptance of immigrants.

Much of the money (and resources for specialized personnel) that school  districts like Jefferson Parish need cannot come from the limited resources at  the local level or from the state, which faces its own budget shortfalls. It  has to come from a federal initiative.

The alternative is not to block immigration. My father emigrated from Honduras  in 1918 as a child and received his citizenship while fighting in World War II.  But we should recognize that the stress on American students, who have plenty  of challenges of their own, is greater in districts with limited funding and so  many undocumented children."

On the whole, immigrants have a limited, if any, effect on job growth for  native-born U.S. workers. But they do add to the economy greatly.

In recent years, foreign-born immigrants have established a disproportionately  large share of small businesses, start-ups in Silicon Valley, and international  patents.

Contrary to common assumptions, legal and  undocumented immigrant workers typically do pay taxes, including on their  incomes, just as U.S. citizens do. And immigrants, both legal and undocumented,  are less likely to commit serious crimes.

When it comes to education, my particular area of study, recent immigrants  overall tend to perform better on several educational outcomes than native-born  counterparts whose families have resided in the U.S. for longer.

My colleague Johnelle Sparks and I have found that first-generation immigrant  students enrolled in four-year colleges or universities are actually more  likely than other students to finish their bachelor's degrees within six years.  Undocumented immigrant students in both the K-12 and college systems  demonstrate significant resilience, academic engagement in their studies and  civic involvement - often serving as leaders in their schools.

In a country where the historically predominant white racial/ethnic group is  aging rapidly, recent immigrants infuse the American work force with a younger  population. For example, Latinos, who are the largest immigrant group, had an  average age of 27 years old in the 2010 Census, compared with the average white  age of 42. Demographers have called the crucial capacity to replenish an aging  labor market with younger individuals the ""demographic dividend"" - It is  immigrants who significantly sustain the population of the U.S. work force.

That is not to say that many immigrant students don't face challenges in  academic achievement and educational attainment, both at the K-12 and  postsecondary levels.

""Drug treatment"" is a multidimensional process in terms of how it  happens and over what time frame it occurs.","There is little question that civil commitment saves lives of severely addicted  people in the short term by abruptly interrupting cycles of extreme  self-destruction. This acute rescue function is not enough, however.

While everyone prefers that patients voluntarily get help instead of being  forced into it, the rate of drop-out from voluntary commitment after several  weeks is a common problem. Drop out almost always means relapse. Civil  commitment - with patients' legal right to challenge, of course - provides the  leverage to remain in care.

But can treatment work if it is compelled? Yes. There is ample evidence that it  is at least as effective, and sometimes more effective, than voluntary care.  Again, the reason is retention: The longer one stays in treatment, the more  time spent toward managing cravings and other negative states; repairing family  relationships and starting new, healthier networks; finding new modes of  fulfillment; and developing realistic future plans.

Importantly, after initial stabilization and detox, treatment need not take  place in an institution. Structured supervision, ideally supplemented with  incentives for clean drug tests and immediate consequences, boasts a promising  track record. For opiate dependence, opiod-receptor blockers such as naltrexone  or replacement medications such as buprenorphine can reduce craving  considerably.

Both the public and physicians generally endorse involuntary care and  containment for psychotic people who can't care for themselves or pose a danger  to others. The same for suicidal individuals.

But what about a patient just revived from overdose with Narcan (which  instantly reverses opiate overdose)? If this person walks out the emergency  room door - as is common -- it's almost guaranteed he or she will hunt for more  drugs. To a physician, it can feel like abandonment to sign the patient out or  discharge against medical advice.

Severely addicted people are not delusional and, thus, not intrinsically beyond  reason. Nor are they fully autonomous. One hopes a physician-initiated  three-day hold, of the kind Massachusetts Governor Baker is proposing, would  provide a respite (paired with a signal to the patient of the gravity of the  situation) during which he or she ends up agreeing to long-term care. Coercion  should be an option of last resort for those at grave risk.

But if help is still refused and the individual is therefore mandated to  monitored quality treatment, over time he or she often becomes open to change."

First, many universities do not share the results of the  student evaluations with students so a forum to share observations is  necessary. Secondly, many instructors assume that just because they are experts  in their field, they are experts in teaching, which is false. Third, many  assume that students are incapable of making accurate evaluations when in fact,  students who deal with five or more instructors every semester for 20 semesters  have a sizeable knowledge base with which to make comparisons, whereas most  instructors have no idea how their teaching compares to their peers. Lastly, a  savvy reader of ratings can easily determine which are poor grade, grudge  ratings and which provided detailed information that is useful. Most genuine  student feedback relates to issues of fairness and classroom management, e.g.  the professor who ""lectures"" by reading from the textbook, the professor who is  a stickler for punctuality, or the professor who deducts points for answers  deemed to be ""dumb"".

That's no small purchase. To blindly trust that I am spending money to enroll  in a class taught by a professor who is a good teacher, especially in my major,  would be foolish. The reality is some professors do a better job than others,  and Rate My Professors helps reveal which do.

With the near-crippling cost of tuition, Rate My Professors is a valuable tool  for students to ensure they get the best return out of their educational  investments."

However, students with poor professors are probably more likely to  have extreme views. There is strength in numbers. If a professor has 50  vitriolic comments on Rate My Professor (RMP), there is probably something  wrong with the professor and not with the commenters' extreme bias. If you are  adventurous you can cite the AAUP research and ignore the warnings from the  commenters on RMP and register for the class, but you will probably regret it.  Having read many RMP reviews, I would say that the majority of comments are not  in the realm of extreme, making it easy to filter. I am not saying RMP is  flawless though. You can't just rely on the numerical rating. You need to read  the reviews discerningly and with an analytic approach. Also the professor  needs to have enough ratings and comments for you to analyze and draw your own  conclusion. Perhaps comments at some schools could be more biased than others.  However, in my own personal experience, RMP has been spot on every time if the  professor has enough comments and if you read them carefully. I agree though  that RMP should not be used for official evaluations, but it could be used as a  tipoff for evaluators to take a closer look at some professors' performance.  Being an academic though is not all about teaching. It is also about creating  knowledge. Some academics might be great thinkers, but poor teachers. There  needs to be a room for both.","Recent college student protests calling for increased faculty diversity left  people wondering why there aren't more fulltime faculty of color in our  universities.

Using student evaluations for promotion and retention decisions without  supplemental data is also troubling in light of research finding that when  whites rate the performance of a person of color for the purposes of giving  feedback to a third party, they consistently rate the person of color lower  than the white person. Conversely, when whites evaluate a person of color for  purposes of giving feedback to that person directly, the person of color being  evaluated actually receives more favorable marks than the white person being  evaluated.

I have 2 cats and when we got them declawed they didn't  stop using their litter box, didn't start biting, and weren't in any pain.

Contrary to popular belief, there appears to be no significant dog and cat  overpopulation documented by the successful supply of dogs from commercial and  private breeders and the continued decrease in cat numbers because household  have fewer of them. What is happening is that there are too many adult pets  being surrendered to shelters, many to die. The most common reason for  relinquishment are behavior problems. For cats, the problems are spraying and  property damage cause by scratching. There are strategies to lessen behavior  problems but many cats are just not able to resist scratching so owners abandon  them or give them to shelters.

Cat declawing, as a last resort, is a reasonable alternative. Research I've  conducted with colleagues shows that declawed cats stay in people's homes  longer; that is, it keeps people from giving their cats away. Declawed cats do  not exhibit any more bad behaviors, including biting of people, than cats that  are not declawed.

Another very important issue is the death of small wild mammals and birds.  Studies show that cats do considerable damage to wildlife. I would like to see  study on whether declawed cats kill fewer song birds, which is a growing  problem around the world, and a major reason for catching stray cats. Declawed  cats are kept as indoor pets more than non-declawed pets, and being home will  protect wildlife.

Declawing a cat should be viewed as a last resort and should not be a crime."

Today, a college degree is, metaphorically speaking, a debased currency.

College is not what it used to be.

The reason is simple: money.

College has become a vehicle for putting a generation of credulous customers  into indentured servitude. Debt is slavery and banks and colleges are the slave  traders.

When university student bodies comprised an intellectual elite, a college  education was a mark of high achievement. When student populations comprise  people who are average or below, some of whom, incredibly, are functionally  illiterate and innumerate when they matriculate, a college degree has been  rendered *worthless*.

The reasons colleges were opened up to all, academically able or not?

1) To provide false hope to a disenfranchised, economically decimated middle  class.

2) To make money: Schools and student loans have generated *trillions* in  profits.

Therefore, yes...

College should be free because the price should reflect the average fundamental  economic value of the service provided: *zero*.","College should be affordable.

First, free college isn't free, it simply shifts costs from students to  taxpayers and caps tuition at zero. That tuition cap limits college spending to  whatever the public is willing to invest. But it does not change the cost of  college, or what institutions actually spend per student. If the past is any  guide, that cost will continue to grow, and an influx of federal money may lead  profligate administrators to spend even more.

The key question, then, is what happens if public generosity does not keep pace  with rising college costs, increases in demand, or both? Barring a drastic  improvement in efficiency, tuition-free colleges won't have the resources to  serve additional students without compromising the quality of their offerings.

As progressive advocates of free college are so eager to point out, public  funding hasn't kept up with such changes in the past. For instance, California  has the cheapest community college fees in the nation. During the recession,  enrollments boomed and the state budget for higher education took a hit. Unable  to raise additional revenue through a tuition increase, California's community  colleges turned away 600,000 students.

A national push for tuition-free college would strain public budgets even  further, leading to shortages rather than increased access. And because middle  and upper-income students will gobble up many of the free public slots,  rationing will hurt those who need access the most.

Advocates will likely argue that federal policy can simply force policymakers  to increase funding in response to changes. But today's political coalition  will be hardpressed to tie the hands of tomorrow's, especially when times are  tough.

Second, free college plans assume that tuition prices are the main obstacle to  student success, looking past problems of educational quality and college  readiness. Take community colleges, where federal grants cover the price of  tuition for the average low-income student. Despite free tuition, just  one-third of students from the bottom income quartile who started at a  community college in 2003 finished a degree or certificate by 2009. Two-year  students from the top income quartile didn't do much better (42 percent).

These numbers suggest that lackluster outcomes are not entirely, or even  mostly, a function of tuition prices, but reflect deeper problems. Like the  fact that 60 to 70 percent of community college students have to take at least  one remedial course, as do 40 percent of those at public four-year  institutions. Or the fact that students who attend public four-year colleges  with lower graduation rates are less likely to finish than similar peers who  attend better schools.

The key question, then, is what happens if public generosity does not keep pace  with rising college costs, increases in demand, or both? Barring a drastic  improvement in efficiency, tuition-free colleges won't have the resources to  serve additional students without compromising the quality of their offerings.

As progressive advocates of free college are so eager to point out, public  funding hasn't kept up with such changes in the past. For instance, California  has the cheapest community college fees in the nation. During the recession,  enrollments boomed and the state budget for higher education took a hit. Unable  to raise additional revenue through a tuition increase, California's community  colleges turned away 600,000 students.

A national push for tuition-free college would strain public budgets even  further, leading to shortages rather than increased access. And because middle  and upper-income students will gobble up many of the free public slots,  rationing will hurt those who need access the most.

Advocates will likely argue that federal policy can simply force policymakers  to increase funding in response to changes. But today's political coalition  will be hardpressed to tie the hands of tomorrow's, especially when times are  tough.

Second, free college plans assume that tuition prices are the main obstacle to  student success, looking past problems of educational quality and college  readiness. Take community colleges, where federal grants cover the price of  tuition for the average low-income student. Despite free tuition, just  one-third of students from the bottom income quartile who started at a  community college in 2003 finished a degree or certificate by 2009. Two-year  students from the top income quartile didn't do much better (42 percent).

These numbers suggest that lackluster outcomes are not entirely, or even  mostly, a function of tuition prices, but reflect deeper problems. Like the  fact that 60 to 70 percent of community college students have to take at least  one remedial course, as do 40 percent of those at public four-year  institutions. Or the fact that students who attend public four-year colleges  with lower graduation rates are less likely to finish than similar peers who  attend better schools.

Rather than spread scarce federal money across all students, policymakers  should instead target those resources toward those who need it most and empower  them to choose the option - public or private - that fits their needs. A  valuable degree is worth the investment even if you have to pay something for  it."

Although people born into or trapped in poverty may  be unable to currently afford it, the economical consequences would hinder  colleges' ability to efficiently educate its students. Currently most if not  all colleges provide financial aid for those who struggle to provide funds and  in addition it should be the government's responsibility to address those who,  even with financial aid, cannot afford it. On that note, the person wishing for  higher education should meet some requirements such as a diploma or GED, or  prior successful college courses taken if at one time it was within reach, etc.  Though it may seem unfair, we are supplied with more than enough money to  complete primary and secondary education.

Just as well there are some people who, regardless of the cost or availability,  do not desire the advanced education. Those unwilling are in the most  undeserving. College degrees progressively open doors to new opportunities and  more highly rewarding career choices. If every person were to have access to  wealth then man's greed, in theory, would slowly diminish and remove the middle  class and de-revolutionize the state of life and functionality of the U.S. The  cost of a college degree is supposed to be something a student is willing to  endure as they are to use their abilities acquired through that degree to pay  for loans and the education.
