Graduate and undergraduate degrees are very, very different things.  Undergraduates are ""finding themselves,"" making broad explorations of the  world, grappling with big questions that they still think they might be able to  answer.

Undergrads are much more strongly  shaped by their environment than grad students. As a grad student, yes, culture  matters, and I am influenced by my academic environment.
