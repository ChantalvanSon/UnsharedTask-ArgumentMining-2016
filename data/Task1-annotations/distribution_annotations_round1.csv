"Dd001","#5","Sweet Briar Is Fighting an Up-Hill Battle ."," The New York Times ran an article on March 5, on Elaine Pao, on how women in the workplace are judged as bossy or abrasive, if they assert themselves. Other news media add to that that if they don't, they are told they are too quiet and deferential for promotion and responsibility. Some add that women are the worst judges of other women. Having graduated from one women's college (Smith) and now teaching at another (Sweet Briar), I would say that women who have gone to women's colleges do not share these disappointing biases. Assertive women? Women proud and confident to display mastery of a problem, and to argue their perspective over and against that of a superior? These women are common as peas here: we respect them, and expect them. Our students also learn to respect that quiet one - for they know that one may have the sharpest insights, once invited to speak. Of course, not all women should go to women's colleges. And those who do have a range of experiences and come out with diverse strengths and capabilities. And of course there are all sorts of social tensions flaring in any residential campus, all-female or co-ed. But one thing students learn at an all-women's college is to respect other women, in all their diversity.","0","0","0","0","0","0"

Although these notifications are generally short in duration, they can prompt task-irrelevant thoughts, or mind wandering, which has been shown to damage task performance. We found that cellular phone notifications alone significantly disrupted performance on an attention-demanding task, even when participants did not directly interact with a mobile device during the task.

Abstract It is well documented that interacting with a mobile phone is associated with poorer performance on concurrently performed tasks because limited attentional resources must be shared between tasks. However, mobile phones generate auditory or tactile notifications to alert users of incoming calls and messages. Although these notifications are generally short in duration, they can prompt task-irrelevant thoughts, or mind wandering, which has been shown to damage task performance. We found that cellular phone notifications alone significantly disrupted performance on an attention-demanding task, even when participants did not directly interact with a mobile device during the task. The magnitude of observed distraction effects was comparable in magnitude to those seen when users actively used a mobile phone, either for voice calls or text messaging.

A whole generation brought up communicating with simplistic technology while my teens kids will be speaking in sentences again using facial expressions etc, cos technology by then will be more complex. So it is just this generation who will be deprived, socially inept and unable to communicate with voice and expression when the technology advances. 3. Cyberbullying is a huge problem as there is no refuge 4. And too much nasty sex and violence. My 14 year old teenage son told me the other days that 40% of girls like anal sex and there is no emotion in hooking up! Plus he has seen things you would not believe on the internet. How can I tell him and more impressionable daughter about love and respect when Kim Kardashian is twerking her way to a fortune. The good role models are drowned out by the trash, click bait and the endless selfies. 5. They dont live they pose. They dont speak they look at each other on screens.
