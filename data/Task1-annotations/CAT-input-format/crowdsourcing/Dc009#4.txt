COMMENT:
Too
many
humans
have
high
expectation
of
animals.
Even
kids.
If
you
can
not
have
patience
and
understanding
,then
don't
have
pets
or
kids.
We
save
declawed
cat
being
throw
out
on
streets
age
two
.
I
had
cats
all
my
life
and
seen
a
cat
that
chronically
flicker
,lick
,sensitive
to
touch,
paws
swell,bites,
picks
fights,cries
for
warmth
when
slit
of
cold
temperature
,
scared
people
beside
human
parents,
and
she
has
pieces
of
bone
loose
in
her
paws.
She
6
going
7
.She
has
to
sleep
on
a
heating
pad
and
a
few
drops
of
ACV
for
keeping
inflammation
down.
Her
legs
is
slowly
bowing
out
from
mutation
and
inflammation
from
declaw.No
vet
will
help
her
until
we
pay.But
call
me
a
liar.
At
first
,i
thought
i
was
saving
abandon
cat,but
learn
from
what
declaw
was
and
why
it
happens
from
this
cat
coming
into
our
lives.
We
may
not
have
money
,but
lease
she
a
loving
home.
Shame
humans
whom
dump,mutilate
,
abuse,
etc.
So
others
deal
with
what
could
not!
X
and
y
generation
is
cleaning
gi
and
babyboomers
mess.
This
many
of
them!

Declawing
a
Pet
Should
Be
Illegal
,
Period
.
<EOS>
Declawing
is
not
some
sort
of
specialized
manicure
that
only
a
vet
can
do
,
it
is
amputation
of
the
toe
bones
that
contain
the
claws
.
<EOS>
Legislation
prohibiting
this
surgery
is
necessary
to
protect
cats
from
this
often
debilitating
procedure
.
<EOS>
The
United
States
veterinary
profession
has
rationalized
breaking
its
oath
to
``
do
no
harm
''
when
it
comes
to
declawing
.
<EOS>
Vets
will
say
that
by
declawing
a
cat
,
they
are
ensuring
a
cat
a
home
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
how
they
can
say
that
.
<EOS>
If
an
owner
is
so
intolerant
of
a
cat
scratching
furniture
,
that
same
owner
is
not
likely
to
be
tolerant
when
his
declawed
cat
stops
using
the
litter
box
because
the
sand
hurts
its
amputated
toe
nubs
,
or
when
that
cat
starts
biting
to
protect
itself
because
it
has
no
claws
.
<EOS>
Both
of
these
behavior
problems
have
been
noticed
in
cats
after
declawing
.
<EOS>
Vets
also
offer
another
unfounded
excuse
that
they
only
declaw
cats
to
protect
immuno-compromised
humans
.
<EOS>
But
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
says
that
declawing
the
cats
of
people
living
with
immuno-compromised
individuals
is
``
not
advised
.
''
<EOS>
In
many
countries
,
declawing
is
illegal
or
considered
unethical
by
veterinary
professionals
,
and
there
,
immuno-compromised
people
are
able
to
cope
with
cat
claws
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
declawed
cats
,
especially
those
in
pain
,
are
likely
to
bite
harder
and
more
often
than
their
clawed
counterparts
.
<EOS>
Bite
wounds
are
almost
always
far
more
serious
than
scratches
.
<EOS>
Although
some
veterinarians
offer
discount
coupons
for
declawing
and
most
recommend
only
declawing
kittens
or
cats
under
two
years
,
many
vets
will
claim
that
they
declaw
as
a
``
last
resort
,
''
after
all
humane
options
have
failed
.
<EOS>
They
will
say
that
they
try
to
talk
everyone
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
that
is
true
,
why
does
the
New
York
State
Veterinary
Medical
Society
oppose
this
bill
?
<EOS>
Isn'
t
the
ultimate
way
to
talk
people
out
of
declawing
simply
to
say
it
is
illegal
?
<EOS>
