COMMENT:
I
disagree
with
this
article.
Working
to
help
pay
for
college
is
a
great
character-builder,
and
provides
important
real-world
experience.
To
get
to
the
root
of
the
problem,
it
is
critical
to
remember
that
public
universities
were
affordable
for
decades,
before
student
loans
provided
the
exploitative
"business
model"
to
justify
exorbitant
salaries
and
benefits
for
what
were
once
known
as
"public
servants".
<EOS>
Public
Higher
Education
Should
Be
Universal
and
Free
.
<EOS>
College
should
be
affordable
.
<EOS>
It
's
hard
to
find
an
American
family
who
doesn'
t
agree
.
<EOS>
But
most
politicians
continue
to
think
that
the
way
to
make
college
more
affordable
is
to
target
financial
aid
to
low-income
students
.
<EOS>
After
15
years
studying
public
higher
education
,
and
testing
the
effects
of
financial
aid
,
I
disagree
.
<EOS>
Targeted
financial
aid
isn'
t
getting
the
job
done
.
<EOS>
It
's
time
for
universal
public
higher
education
.
<EOS>
Today
's
targeted
financial
aid
provides
too
little
to
too
few
.
<EOS>
The
onerous
and
inaccurate
Free
Application
for
Federal
Student
Aid
divides
American
families
into
two
unlucky
groups
.
<EOS>
On
the
one
hand
,
students
deemed
deserving
of
help
receive
aid
that
is
usually
far
short
of
the
resources
required
to
effectively
pursue
their
studies
and
graduate
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
,
students
from
middle-class
families
are
treated
as
if
they
can
manage
with
loans
alone
.
<EOS>
This
is
both
bad
public
policy
and
bad
politics
.
<EOS>
Efforts
to
make
college
affordable
via
targeted
financial
aid
are
divisive
.
<EOS>
Families
that
don'
t
get
aid
resent
those
that
do
.
<EOS>
Over
time
,
the
purchasing
power
of
programs
like
the
Pell
Grant
has
eroded
for
lack
of
political
support
,
and
recipients
have
been
denigrated
as
lazy
,
``
academically
adrift
''
and
akin
to
``
welfare
recipients
.
''
<EOS>
Compare
that
to
the
solid
support
for
Medicare
and
Social
Security
,
which
offer
benefits
to
all
senior
citizens
.
<EOS>
How
we
finance
public
higher
education
is
a
matter
of
political
will
.
<EOS>
Universal
public
higher
education
recognizes
that
college
must
be
affordable
for
all
if
it
is
to
help
drive
our
economy
and
our
democracy
.
<EOS>
Lowering
prices
for
students
is
just
the
start
-
it
also
comes
with
shared
responsibility
for
funding
higher
education
and
ensuring
quality
.
<EOS>
It
helps
students
focus
on
learning
rather
than
working
so
that
they
complete
degrees
faster
and
having
acquired
more
skills
.
<EOS>
Best
of
all
,
it
recognizes
that
ability
to
pay
is
not
a
marker
of
talent
in
America
-
unleashing
the
potential
in
us
all
.
<EOS>
