COMMENT:
While
I
don't
exactly
agree
with
declawing
cats
I
don't
think
it
should
be
illegal.
If
you
have
a
child
you
should
get
your
cat
declawed
so
it
doesn't
harm
your
child.
Most
people
probably
don't
know
what
exactly
goes
on
in
the
process
of
declawing
a
cat.
Once
more
people
find
out
what
goes
on
they'll
probably
be
against
it.
I
have
2
cats
and
when
we
got
them
declawed
they
didn't
stop
using
their
litter
box,
didn't
start
biting,
and
weren't
in
any
pain.
If
declawing
cats
was
extremely
painful
and
severely
changed
the
way
they
lived,
veterinarians
probably
wouldn't
subject
animals
to
that
kind
of
pain.
Just
because
you
get
your
cat
declawed
doesn't
mean
you
hate
cats
and
shouldn't
own
one.
That's
a
personal
decision
that
you
make
for
reasons
based
on
your
life.
Just
because
you
don't
want
your
furniture
and
floors
being
scratched
doesn't
mean
you
should
have
to
pay
a
big
fine
or
go
to
jail.

Declawing
a
Pet
Should
Be
Illegal
,
Period
.
<EOS>
Declawing
is
not
some
sort
of
specialized
manicure
that
only
a
vet
can
do
,
it
is
amputation
of
the
toe
bones
that
contain
the
claws
.
<EOS>
Legislation
prohibiting
this
surgery
is
necessary
to
protect
cats
from
this
often
debilitating
procedure
.
<EOS>
The
United
States
veterinary
profession
has
rationalized
breaking
its
oath
to
``
do
no
harm
''
when
it
comes
to
declawing
.
<EOS>
Vets
will
say
that
by
declawing
a
cat
,
they
are
ensuring
a
cat
a
home
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
how
they
can
say
that
.
<EOS>
If
an
owner
is
so
intolerant
of
a
cat
scratching
furniture
,
that
same
owner
is
not
likely
to
be
tolerant
when
his
declawed
cat
stops
using
the
litter
box
because
the
sand
hurts
its
amputated
toe
nubs
,
or
when
that
cat
starts
biting
to
protect
itself
because
it
has
no
claws
.
<EOS>
Both
of
these
behavior
problems
have
been
noticed
in
cats
after
declawing
.
<EOS>
Vets
also
offer
another
unfounded
excuse
that
they
only
declaw
cats
to
protect
immuno-compromised
humans
.
<EOS>
But
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
says
that
declawing
the
cats
of
people
living
with
immuno-compromised
individuals
is
``
not
advised
.
''
<EOS>
In
many
countries
,
declawing
is
illegal
or
considered
unethical
by
veterinary
professionals
,
and
there
,
immuno-compromised
people
are
able
to
cope
with
cat
claws
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
declawed
cats
,
especially
those
in
pain
,
are
likely
to
bite
harder
and
more
often
than
their
clawed
counterparts
.
<EOS>
Bite
wounds
are
almost
always
far
more
serious
than
scratches
.
<EOS>
Although
some
veterinarians
offer
discount
coupons
for
declawing
and
most
recommend
only
declawing
kittens
or
cats
under
two
years
,
many
vets
will
claim
that
they
declaw
as
a
``
last
resort
,
''
after
all
humane
options
have
failed
.
<EOS>
They
will
say
that
they
try
to
talk
everyone
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
that
is
true
,
why
does
the
New
York
State
Veterinary
Medical
Society
oppose
this
bill
?
<EOS>
Isn'
t
the
ultimate
way
to
talk
people
out
of
declawing
simply
to
say
it
is
illegal
?
