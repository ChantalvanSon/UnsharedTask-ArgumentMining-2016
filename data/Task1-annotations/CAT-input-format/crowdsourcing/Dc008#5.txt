COMMENT:
Yet
again,
the
one
in
power
complains
that
the
only
ones
judging
them
should
be
their
colleagues.
What
nonsense!
Good
teachers,
even
tough
ones,
will
get
known
and
attract
eager
students.
I've
rarely,
if
ever,
seen
a
good
teacher
get
a
bad
reputation
(as
a
teacher)
by
anonymous
gossip.
Word
of
mouth
happens,
whether
it's
formal,
on-line
or
oral.
I
find
it
ironic
that
the
final
line
is
"But
using
student
evaluations
to
make
employment
retention
decisions
may
be
allowing
hidden
bias
to
frustrate
efforts
to
diversify
our
faculties."
I
worked
as
a
graduate
TA
for
a
young
prof
who
was
a
magnificent
teacher.
Word
of
mouth
spread
and
his
class
enrollment
ballooned
despite
his
being
a
tough
grader.
But
he
didn't
have
tenure
and
the
department
wanted
someone
with
a
better
reputation,
and
more
status,
so
they
gave
him
notice.
The
student
uproar
was
such
they
found
him
an
extra
semester,
but
after
that,
he
ended
up
leaving
the
field.
I
cannot
say
anything
bad
about
their
permanent
selection
for
the
slot.
He
was
a
fine
teacher
too,
a
superb
scholar,
and
a
likeable
guy
as
well.
But
they
had
no
compunction
with
non-retention
for
an
obviously
talented
young
teacher.
None.

Teacher
Evaluations
Could
Be
Hurting
Faculty
Diversity
at
Universities
.
<EOS>
Recent
college
student
protests
calling
for
increased
faculty
diversity
left
people
wondering
why
there
aren'
t
more
fulltime
faculty
of
color
in
our
universities
.
<EOS>
One
reason
may
be
that
faculty
of
color
are
not
retained
at
the
same
rate
as
their
white
counterparts
,
and
bias
in
student
teaching
evaluations
could
be
contributing
to
that
disparity
.
<EOS>
A
public
example
of
student
evaluation
of
college
teaching
can
be
found
on
Rate
My
Professors
.
<EOS>
The
problem
with
such
evaluative
tools
,
according
to
research
by
the
American
Association
of
University
Professors
,
is
that
students
with
extreme
views
are
more
likely
to
complete
an
evaluation
of
a
teacher
.
<EOS>
In
these
instances
,
the
``
sample
''
of
students
surveyed
about
the
professor
's
performance
is
skewed
,
tainting
the
validity
of
the
findings
.
<EOS>
Using
student
evaluations
for
promotion
and
retention
decisions
without
supplemental
data
is
also
troubling
in
light
of
research
finding
that
when
whites
rate
the
performance
of
a
person
of
color
for
the
purposes
of
giving
feedback
to
a
third
party
,
they
consistently
rate
the
person
of
color
lower
than
the
white
person
.
<EOS>
Conversely
,
when
whites
evaluate
a
person
of
color
for
purposes
of
giving
feedback
to
that
person
directly
,
the
person
of
color
being
evaluated
actually
receives
more
favorable
marks
than
the
white
person
being
evaluated
.
<EOS>
What
's
more
,
in
Deborah
Rhode
's
fascinating
book
,
``
The
Beauty
Bias
,
''
we
learn
that
evaluators
are
more
likely
to
rate
physically
attractive
performers
more
favorably
than
those
deemed
unattractive
,
and
that
people
with
strong
African
physical
features
are
deemed
less
attractive
than
those
without
such
features
.
<EOS>
With
all
of
this
bias
in
student
evaluations
,
we
should
be
cautious
in
using
them
to
make
employment
decisions
.
<EOS>
As
the
consumers
of
higher
education
,
student
voices
are
important
.
<EOS>
But
using
student
evaluations
to
make
employment
retention
decisions
may
be
allowing
hidden
bias
to
frustrate
efforts
to
diversify
our
faculties
.
