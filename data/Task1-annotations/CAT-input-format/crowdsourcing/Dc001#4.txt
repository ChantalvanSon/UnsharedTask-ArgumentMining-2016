COMMENT:
Nobody
taxes
are
used
to
"Spanish
speaking
families"
kids.,
as
you
called
them.
Their
parent
work
very
hard
up
two
3
jobs
to
be
able
to
support
their
family.
To
give
their
kids
the
best
life
they
can.
Mexican
families
don't
even
get
taxes
back,
in
matter
a
fact
they
take
a
whole
lot
of
money
from
them.
And
as
you
say
your
daughter
and
your
son
in
law
work
hard
for
their
two
kids,
will
that's
great
to
know.
But,
as
far
as
i
know
Mexican
parent
don't
really
buy
to
rich
things,
or
buy
the
best
quality
of
clothes.
Most
of
the
times
they
buy
clothes
that
are
in
sales.
More
when
you
have
up
to
3
kids
or
more.
Mexican
families
rather
spend
money
on
their
kids
to
be
able
provide
them
clothes
but
may
not
be
the
best
quality
of
clothes
but
at
least
clothes
that
can
cover
their
bodies.
Mexican
families
save
money
and
save
smart
to
be
able
have
food
on
the
table
and
a
roof
under
their
families
heads.
Mexican
families
are
hard
working
people
who
don't
care
to
burn
their
self
under
the
sun.
Or
to
wake
up
3
or
4
in
the
morning
to
go
to
work
and
come
back
till
7
at
night.
Most
of
the
times
they
don't
spend
much
time
with
their
families
as
you
as
Whites
spend
time
with
grandparent
mom
and
dad
sister
and
brothers
uncles
and
aunts.

A
Problem
for
Some
School
Districts
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
secret
that
many
public
school
systems
struggle
to
find
adequate
resources
to
teach
students
who
are
behind
grade
level
,
some
of
whom
have
significant
other
challenges
in
their
home
lives
.
<EOS>
Undocumented
children
,
especially
those
who
come
in
at
middle
and
high
school
levels
,
often
fall
under
this
umbrella
:
They
are
usually
at
least
two
grade
levels
behind
,
but
assessing
their
skills
is
difficult
because
they
have
few
if
any
records.
(
The
language
barrier
,
in
many
cases
,
may
keep
children
who
are
more
proficient
in
the
content
,
but
not
English
,
from
being
in
the
appropriate
class
level.
)
<EOS>
Often
,
immigrant
children
have
experienced
difficulty
or
trauma
,
and
they
come
to
school
with
high
levels
of
anxiety
and
fear
.
<EOS>
In
Jefferson
Parish
,
Louisiana
,
where
I
was
superintendent
from
2011
to
January
of
this
year
,
we
had
a
major
influx
of
Central
American
students
last
school
year
.
<EOS>
More
than
a
thousand
new
children
were
enrolled
last
fall
,
and
by
February
2014
we
had
the
highest
concentration
of
students
with
limited
English
proficiency
(
around
10
percent
of
the
students
)
of
any
public-school
system
in
the
state
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
to
say
that
immigrants
,
authorized
or
not
,
shouldn'
t
be
in
the
school
system
.
<EOS>
When
it
comes
to
our
educational
mission
and
duty
,
the
passion
and
commitment
is
there
,
so
it
is
important
to
try
to
separate
schooling
from
politics
.
<EOS>
But
better
federal
and
monetary
assistance
is
needed
.
<EOS>
First
,
it
is
a
bureaucratic
challenge
to
assess
the
needs
of
immigrant
children
,
many
of
whom
have
unusual
family
structures
,
especially
without
hiring
more
Spanish-speaking
teachers
and
bilingual
paraprofessionals
.
<EOS>
We
need
extra
classrooms
,
extra
teachers
and
counselors
,
and
money
for
transportation
costs
and
extended
year
programs
to
accelerate
instruction
that
will
bring
students
to
grade
level
.
<EOS>
Second
,
we
need
to
help
immigrant
children
who
are
behind
learn
faster
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
undocumented
students
need
a
similar
level
of
attention
as
special-needs
students
,
or
their
chances
of
dropping
out
soar.
(
This
brings
another
societal
cost
as
those
who
cannot
find
identification
in
schools
,
and
have
few
family
members
nearby
,
have
limited
job
opportunities
and
become
prime
candidates
for
gangs.
)
<EOS>
Third
,
we
want
an
open
and
accepting
culture
at
school
for
all
our
students
,
but
resentment
can
build
when
limited
resources
are
spent
on
undocumented
children
.
<EOS>
The
scarcity
of
funds
can
put
up
a
significant
social
barrier
to
acceptance
of
immigrants
.
<EOS>
Much
of
the
money
(
and
resources
for
specialized
personnel
)
that
school
districts
like
Jefferson
Parish
need
cannot
come
from
the
limited
resources
at
the
local
level
or
from
the
state
,
which
faces
its
own
budget
shortfalls
.
<EOS>
It
has
to
come
from
a
federal
initiative
.
<EOS>
The
alternative
is
not
to
block
immigration
.
<EOS>
My
father
emigrated
from
Honduras
in
1918
as
a
child
and
received
his
citizenship
while
fighting
in
World
War
II
.
<EOS>
But
we
should
recognize
that
the
stress
on
American
students
,
who
have
plenty
of
challenges
of
their
own
,
is
greater
in
districts
with
limited
funding
and
so
many
undocumented
children
.
<EOS>
