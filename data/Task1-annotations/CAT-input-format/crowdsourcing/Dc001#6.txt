COMMENT:
This
opinion
is
astounding.
At
least
Mr.
Meza
acknowledges
"resentment
can
build
when
limited
resources
are
spent
on
undocumented
(aka
illegal)
children."
He
has
that
part
right.
No,
it
is
certainly
not
the
fault
of
the
children
that
their
parents
are
law-breakers
diluting
limited
US
resources
and
pressuring
already
burdened
school
districts
(and
hospitals,
and
public
infrastructure,
etc.,
etc.)
It
is
a
tragedy
&
I
understand
Mr.
Meza's
job
was
to
try
and
run
the
school
district
as
well
as
possible
under
the
circumstances.
But
why
should
illegal
aliens
who
fail
to
respect
the
laws
of
the
United
States
be
rewarded
with
federal
dollars
(that
US
citizen
taxpayers
provide)
to
educate
their
children?
The
countries
of
northern
Europe
&
Scandinavia
have
traditionally
been
able
to
offer
a
strong
social
welfare
state
because
there
is
a
shared
culture
and
moderate
homogeneity.
They
are
now
facing
the
rise
of
right-wing
parties
because
of
the
abuse
of
that
same
social
welfare
state
from
migrants.
And
the
reality
in
America
is
that
the
current
de
facto
open
borders
policy
is
undermining
support
for
not
only
public
education
but
the
entire
modern
welfare
state
and
all
public
works,
not
to
mention
respect
for
our
laws.
Why
should
anyone
comply
with
any
law
at
all
then?
The
open
borders
policy
is
destroying
the
unity
of
America.
<EOS>
A
Problem
for
Some
School
Districts
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
secret
that
many
public
school
systems
struggle
to
find
adequate
resources
to
teach
students
who
are
behind
grade
level
,
some
of
whom
have
significant
other
challenges
in
their
home
lives
.
<EOS>
Undocumented
children
,
especially
those
who
come
in
at
middle
and
high
school
levels
,
often
fall
under
this
umbrella
:
They
are
usually
at
least
two
grade
levels
behind
,
but
assessing
their
skills
is
difficult
because
they
have
few
if
any
records.
(
The
language
barrier
,
in
many
cases
,
may
keep
children
who
are
more
proficient
in
the
content
,
but
not
English
,
from
being
in
the
appropriate
class
level.
)
<EOS>
Often
,
immigrant
children
have
experienced
difficulty
or
trauma
,
and
they
come
to
school
with
high
levels
of
anxiety
and
fear
.
<EOS>
In
Jefferson
Parish
,
Louisiana
,
where
I
was
superintendent
from
2011
to
January
of
this
year
,
we
had
a
major
influx
of
Central
American
students
last
school
year
.
<EOS>
More
than
a
thousand
new
children
were
enrolled
last
fall
,
and
by
February
2014
we
had
the
highest
concentration
of
students
with
limited
English
proficiency
(
around
10
percent
of
the
students
)
of
any
public-school
system
in
the
state
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
to
say
that
immigrants
,
authorized
or
not
,
shouldn'
t
be
in
the
school
system
.
<EOS>
When
it
comes
to
our
educational
mission
and
duty
,
the
passion
and
commitment
is
there
,
so
it
is
important
to
try
to
separate
schooling
from
politics
.
<EOS>
But
better
federal
and
monetary
assistance
is
needed
.
<EOS>
First
,
it
is
a
bureaucratic
challenge
to
assess
the
needs
of
immigrant
children
,
many
of
whom
have
unusual
family
structures
,
especially
without
hiring
more
Spanish-speaking
teachers
and
bilingual
paraprofessionals
.
<EOS>
We
need
extra
classrooms
,
extra
teachers
and
counselors
,
and
money
for
transportation
costs
and
extended
year
programs
to
accelerate
instruction
that
will
bring
students
to
grade
level
.
<EOS>
Second
,
we
need
to
help
immigrant
children
who
are
behind
learn
faster
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
undocumented
students
need
a
similar
level
of
attention
as
special-needs
students
,
or
their
chances
of
dropping
out
soar.
(
This
brings
another
societal
cost
as
those
who
cannot
find
identification
in
schools
,
and
have
few
family
members
nearby
,
have
limited
job
opportunities
and
become
prime
candidates
for
gangs.
)
<EOS>
Third
,
we
want
an
open
and
accepting
culture
at
school
for
all
our
students
,
but
resentment
can
build
when
limited
resources
are
spent
on
undocumented
children
.
<EOS>
The
scarcity
of
funds
can
put
up
a
significant
social
barrier
to
acceptance
of
immigrants
.
<EOS>
Much
of
the
money
(
and
resources
for
specialized
personnel
)
that
school
districts
like
Jefferson
Parish
need
cannot
come
from
the
limited
resources
at
the
local
level
or
from
the
state
,
which
faces
its
own
budget
shortfalls
.
<EOS>
It
has
to
come
from
a
federal
initiative
.
<EOS>
The
alternative
is
not
to
block
immigration
.
<EOS>
My
father
emigrated
from
Honduras
in
1918
as
a
child
and
received
his
citizenship
while
fighting
in
World
War
II
.
<EOS>
But
we
should
recognize
that
the
stress
on
American
students
,
who
have
plenty
of
challenges
of
their
own
,
is
greater
in
districts
with
limited
funding
and
so
many
undocumented
children
.
