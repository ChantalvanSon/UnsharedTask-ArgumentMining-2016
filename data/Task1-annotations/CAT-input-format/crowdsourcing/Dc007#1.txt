COMMENT:
I
want
to
know
what
my
students
think
about
the
classes
I
teach,
but
I
am
unsure
as
to
whose
opinions
I
should
trust.
Do
I
trust
the
A
student
who
does
not
err
often,
is
always
present
and
usually
discursive?
How
about
the
one
who
is
never
mentally
present
and
barely
scores
C's?
Should
I
go
with
the
middle
age
night
class
students
whose
observations
might
be
more
mature
than
those
fresh
out
of
high
school?
What
a
dilemma.
The
truth
is,
I
do
not
trust
most
of
their
opinions,
primarily
because
they
are
given
anonymously,
so
there
is
no
way
we
can
find
out
why
they
say
what
they
say.
And
like
most
anonymous
opinionated
folks,
such
as
those
we
find
online,
they
lie,
and
say
things
they
would
never
say
face
to
face.
Who
is
this
person
who
thinks
I
am
the
best
teacher
ever?
Until
we
stop
the
anonymous
evaluations,
we
will
never
really
know
the
worth
of
their
opinions.
Hey--they
know
who
"gave"
them
their
A's
and
F's,
right?
So--turnabout
is
fairplay.

Before

Whether
buying
a

When
college
students
sign
up
for
classes
taught
by
specific
professors
,
we
are
consumers
too
.

We
pay
tuition
for
classes
that

us

an

ultimately
,
a

We

Rate
My

--
4
million
college
students

<EOS>
For
me
,
it
's
not
about
signing
up
for
an
easy
``
A.
''
<EOS>
I
'll
do
my
best
no
matter
who
delivers
the
lectures
,
but
it
helps
to
have
a
professor
who
can
teach
and

At
Ohio
State
,
the
list
of
professors
is
extensive

<EOS>
Rate
My
Professors
helps
me
narrow
down
my
choices
.
<EOS>
It
tells
me
what
my
peers
think
of
the
various
instructors
.
<EOS>
The
university
has
students
evaluate
professors
,
but
those
responses
aren'
t
available
to
us
.
<EOS>
Why
shouldn'
t
nursing
students
try
to
find
the
best
instructor
for
their
medical
terminology
class
?

That
class
has

For
the
2015-16
academic
year
at
Ohio
State
's
Columbus
campus
,
full-time
tuition
and
fees
for
in-state
residents
is
estimated
at
$
10,037
-
or
$
5,018.50
a
semester
.
<EOS>
If
an
in-state
resident
enrolls
in
the
typical
five
classes
per
semester
,
they
're
paying
more
than
$
1,000
per
course
.
<EOS>
That
's
no
small
purchase
.
<EOS>
To
blindly
trust
that
I
am
spending
money
to
enroll
in
a
class
taught
by
a
professor
who
is
a
good
teacher
,
especially
in
my
major
,
would
be
foolish
.
<EOS>
The
reality
is
some
professors
do
a
better
job
than
others
,
and
Rate
My
Professors
helps
reveal
which
do
.
<EOS>
With
the
near-crippling
cost
of
tuition
,
Rate
My
Professors
is
a
valuable
tool
for
students
to
ensure
they

the

of
