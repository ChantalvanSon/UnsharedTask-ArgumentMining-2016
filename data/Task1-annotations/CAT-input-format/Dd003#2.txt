Training
for
bar
staff
is
the
key.
Staff
need
to
learn
to
identify
the
visible
signs
of
intoxication(
i.e.
slurred
speech,
excessive
ordering
of
drinks,
confusion
etc.,)
etc.
and
stop
service
using
different
techniques
(
wipe
and
swipe,
"can
I
get
you
a
cup
of
coffee?",
"no
more
for
you"
etc.,)
If
all
bar
employees
are
required
(
as
in
Oregon)
to
complete
the
class
and
get
certified
a
lot
of
drunk
driving
and
other
alcohol
related
behavior
can
be
eliminated.
In
Oregon,
since
the
bar
owner
who
serves
the
last
alcoholic
beverage
can
be
held
liable
in
the
event
the
patron
causes
injury,
property
damage
or
death,
certification
is
a
closely
monitored
and
supported
activity
by
the
food
and
wine
industry.
Eliminating
Happy
Hour
won't
solve
the
problem.
People
will
find
other
ways
to
drink
if
they
are
so
inclined.

In
the
beginning
of
my
career
as
a
bartender
,
I
worked
in
a
solid
establishment
with
great
food
and
beverages
that
offered
a
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
I
appreciated
it
because
it
brought
in
clientele
fairly
early
in
the
evening
when
bars
are
often
quiet
.
<EOS>
During
that
hour
,
the
average
check
was
two
drinks
per
person
,
and
they
frequently
would
order
an
appetizer
.
<EOS>
After
it
was
over
,
some
guests
stayed
on
and
ordered
a
meal
.
<EOS>
But
more
often
than
not
,
many
of
the
guests
made
their
way
home
without
much
fanfare
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
happy
hour
or
not
,
the
one
thing
that
I
was
always
diligent
about
was
serving
water
and
frequently
checking
in
with
my
guests
to
make
sure
that
they
were
in
good
shape
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
owners
was
always
on-premise
and
frequently
checked
in
at
the
bar
to
ensure
all
was
going
well
.
<EOS>
In
general
,
offering
food
and
water
and
frequent
check-in
's
with
one
's
patrons
is
not
just
a
good
preventative
--
at
the
core
,
it
's
simply
responsible
hospitality
.
<EOS>
At
this
point
in
my
career
as
an
bar
owner
,
I
can
appreciate
it
for
similar
reasons
.
<EOS>
From
a
financial
perspective
,
bars
can
often
be
fairly
quiet
places
the
first
hour
or
two
after
opening
.
<EOS>
Now
,
when
various
states
are
considering
a
minimum
wage
increase
to
$
15
an
hour
,
a
short
selection
of
drinks
offered
at
a
slight
discount
can
help
to
stimulate
business
and
offset
costs
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
bit
narrowminded
to
think
that
a
happy
hour
ban
is
going
to
drastically
reduce
problems
.
<EOS>
An
establishment
that
offers
food
can
avoid
happy
hour
restrictions
by
leaving
their
drinks
at
full-price
and
discounting
their
food
instead
.
<EOS>
A
guest
can
beat
the
system
by
simply
patronizing
a
bar
that
offers
inexpensive
drinks
during
all
of
its
hours
of
operations
.
<EOS>
We
should
instead
be
addressing
this
issue
at
the
core
with
responsible
service
.
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
happy
hour
bans
,
I
'd
like
to
see
legislature
that
requires
all
food
and
beverage
establishments
to
annually
certify
all
employees
who
serve
alcohol
through
an
accredited
alcohol
management
program
.
<EOS>
New
hires
should
be
put
through
the
program
before
they
start
.
<EOS>
I
've
participated
in
a
number
of
such
certifications
,
and
I
require
that
my
entire
staff
be
certified
.
<EOS>
Every
establishment
has
an
obligation
to
ensure
the
safety
of
its
guests
at
all
times
--
not
solely
during
happy
hour
.
