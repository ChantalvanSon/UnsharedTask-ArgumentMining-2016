COMMENT:
Technology
is
a
thing
of
our
time
and
that
children
should
be
allowed
ample
time
to
experience
and
develop
their
futures
in
the
environments
of
technology
because
we
will
never
reverse
the
trends
of
technological
advancement
around
us.
The
case
of
two
kids
is
presented
where
the
author
acknowledges
that
his
kids
who
binge
on
technology
were
just
as
socially
upbeat
like
the
others.
In
fact,
since
they
have
ample
time
for
technology
at
home,
they
could
spare
time
with
cousins
whom
they
never
often
see
for
a
social
occasion.
This
author
is
a
bit
liberal
and
looks
at
the
world
more
objectively
and
practically.
The
author
recalls
the
fact
that
his
childhood
was
miserable
because
his
exposure
to
technology
was
very
strictly
regulated.
Nonetheless,
he
managed
to
excel
and
currently
has
a
profession
in
the
technology
industry.
The
author
presents
a
case
of
his
kid
who
is
given
ample
time
with
technology
and
it
is
surprising
that
comparing
his
kid
with
the
others
who
are
intensely
regulated,
his
kid
does
better
in
socialization.
Technology
will
always
be
with
us
and
humanity
can
stretch
as
much
as
it
allowed
stretching
without
breaking.
If
kids
use
technologies
safely
and
they
are
exposed
to
a
variety,
they
will
naturally
have
a
balance
on
what
is
more
useful
and
if
parents
simply
guide
by
sharing
insights
and
knowledge,
they
can
manage
their
creative
energies
and
potentials
and
become
even
better
adapted.

Don'
t
Limit
Your
Teen
's
Screen
Time
.
<EOS>
Some
children
grow
up
wanting
to
play
baseball
all
day
,
but
I
wanted
to
play
Castlevania
and
Super
Mario
Brothers
.
<EOS>
Sadly
,
my
parents
believed
I
'd
fry
my
brain
for
the
love
of
videogames
,
so
I
was
limited
to
an
hour
of
screen
time
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
But
that
only
fueled
covert
binging
.
<EOS>
Every
time
I
was
at
a
friend
's
house
,
we
'd
spend
the
whole
time
glued
to
the
Nintendo
system
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
at
family
reunions
,
my
cousins
and
I
would
fight
over
who
got
to
play
next
,
and
when
my
parents
went
out
of
town
,
it
was
a
no-sleep
videogame
free-for-all
.
<EOS>
I
look
back
on
those
years
and
wonder
why
my
parents
thought
that
videogames
were
hurtful
to
my
youth
.
<EOS>
They
taught
me
how
to
tell
stories
,
create
worlds
and
even
how
to
save
and
spend
money
.
<EOS>
Videogames
were
my
first
real
exposure
to
programming
,
and
they
helped
me
realize
my
career
in
technology
.
<EOS>
Regardless
,
we
are
in
a
different
era
.
<EOS>
Today
,
technology
is
so
prevalent
,
it
's
hard
to
keep
it
away
from
children
and
teenagers
.
<EOS>
But
I
don'
t
think
we
should
even
try
.
<EOS>
If
we
restrict
our
kids
'
access
,
while
we
're
emailing
from
an
Apple
Watch
,
they
won'
t
respect
the
rules
when
they
have
a
chance
to
get
around
them
.
<EOS>
As
an
experiment
,
I
stopped
restricting
my
children
's
screen
time
in
my
house
,
and
immediately
saw
results
at
a
recent
family
reunion
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
lives
in
a
strict
,
screen-regulated
home
.
<EOS>
So
,
a
trip
to
Grandma
's
-
where
there
are
no
restrictions
or
parental
controls
-
means
unlimited
SpongeBob
.
<EOS>
While
my
kids
were
out
playing
with
their
cousins
in
the
backyard
,
my
nephew
was
locked
on
the
TV
for
the
entire
evening
.
<EOS>
This
wasn'
t
an
opportunity
for
my
kids
to
binge
on
tech
because
they
couldn'
t
otherwise
-
they
were
more
excited
to
spend
time
with
cousins
they
never
see
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
kids
will
still
binge
.
<EOS>
Adults
binge
.
<EOS>
Netflix
has
built
an
entire
viewing
model
around
binging
.
<EOS>
But
allowing
children
and
teens
to
regulate
their
behavior
like
adults
gives
them
room
to
naturally
modify
their
own
habits
.
<EOS>
Plus
,
many
kids
do
learn
social
and
technical
skills
through
screen
time
,
even
more
so
now
then
when
I
was
growing
up
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
the
vast
majority
of
digital
gaming
today
is
a
social
event
:
Our
kids
are
growing
relationships
online
that
often
blossom
into
lifelong
friendships.
(
Anecdotally
,
I
met
many
of
my
friends
through
online
games
and
even
saw
two
-
a
couple
who
met
through
a
World
of
Warcraft
raid
-
end
up
happily
married.
)
<EOS>
Technology
is
not
going
away
or
becoming
less
popular
.
<EOS>
We
should
let
our
teenagers
build
on
MineCraft
,
mess
around
in
Photoshop
,
and
make
music
in
GarageBand
.
<EOS>
Eliminating
screen
time
is
a
thing
of
the
past
,
and
if
we
want
to
stay
technically
savvy
through
our
60s
,
our
kids
will
be
the
ones
to
teach
us
all
the
new
tricks
.
