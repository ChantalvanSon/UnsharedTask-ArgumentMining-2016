COMMENT:
As
a
depression-prone
person,
I
agree
with
that
portion
of
the
column
most
strongly.
Every
non-specialist
that
I
met
as
an
adolescent
was
unfamiliar
with
(or
at
least
unwilling
to
talk
about)
depression
and
social
anxiety.
Granted,
this
was
before
the
Prozac
and
computer
revolutions,
but
I've
spent
much
of
my
life
engaged
in
problematic
use
of
computers.
At
least
we
need
to
be
aware
of
the
potential
for
serious
mental
and
brain
damage
to
occur.
Anyone
who
wants
a
good
example
of
kids
who
have
had
their
lives
virtually
destroyed
by
computer
addiction
should
watch
the
Frontline
program
"Web
Junkies."
I
was
aghast
as
how
deeply
sunk
into
compulsive
behavior
some
kids
can
find
themselves.
Since
total
abstinence
from
use
of
computers
is
virtually
not
an
option
these
days,
recovery
from
addiction
is
terrifyingly
difficult.

Cyberbullying
Is
a
Bigger
Problem
Than
Screen
Time
Addiction
.
<EOS>
The
harms
that
can
come
to
children
who
use
technology
excessively
-
including
depression
,
behavioral
problems
and
poor
academic
performance
-
are
not
just
caused
by
too
much
screen
time
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
nature
of
the
interactions
that
take
place
through
the
screen
that
count
.
<EOS>
Simply
limiting
screen
time
ignores
the
many
benefits
of
technology
for
teenagers
.
<EOS>
But
cybervictimization
is
a
problem
that
's
become
pervasive
.
<EOS>
The
bullies
have
moved
from
the
playground
to
the
mobile
screen
,
and
there
is
no
escaping
harassment
that
essentially
lives
in
your
pocket
.
<EOS>
Bullying
and
online
harassment
increases
anxiety
and
depression
,
and
it
often
compounds
mental
health
problems
over
multiple
years
.
<EOS>
In
particular
,
race-related
online
victimization
-
including
the
circulation
of
racist
imagery
-
is
on
the
rise
,
with
50
percent
of
adolescents
of
color
reporting
these
incidents
in
2013
,
up
from
32
percent
in
2011
,
according
to
my
own
research
.
<EOS>
These
incidents
are
associated
with
poor
mental
health
and
well-being
,
as
well
as
decreased
academic
motivation
and
behavioral
problems
.
<EOS>
But
scholars
are
beginning
to
make
distinctions
between
screen
time
that
interferes
with
functioning
,
and
that
which
leads
to
more
positive
engagement
.
<EOS>
With
respect
to
problematic
video
game
playing
,
for
example
,
those
who
might
be
considered
``
addicted
''
include
only
about
3
to
5
percent
of
adolescents
.
<EOS>
By
contrast
,
video
game
playing
,
regardless
of
type
,
has
also
been
linked
to
creativity
in
middle
school
students
.
<EOS>
We
don'
t
yet
know
how
much
screen
time
for
positive
uses
,
such
as
content
creation
,
is
too
much
.
<EOS>
But
certain
examples
of
good
works
-
like
that
of
six
middle
school
girls
who
spent
hours
buried
in
code
,
and
created
an
app
to
help
their
blind
classmate
get
around
campus
-
remind
us
of
the
good
that
children
and
teenagers
can
do
with
their
screen
time
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
we
wouldn'
t
want
them
to
forsake
their
schoolwork
or
personal
relationships
,
but
would
we
call
that
kind
of
drive
and
focus
an
``
addiction
''
?
