COMMENT:
Contrary
to
the
perception
that
women's
higher
education
institutions
are
in
trouble,
the
Women's
College
at
Notre
Dame
of
Maryland
University
is
thriving.
This
past
fall,
the
university
welcomed
its
largest
incoming
Women's
College
class
in
seven
years.
Over
the
past
five
years,
the
Women's
College
has
seen
an
11%
growth
in
enrollment
and
a
16%
growth
in
retention.
The
university's
retention
rate
of
85%
is
significantly
higher
than
the
national
average
of
68%.
This
boost
has
not
been
achieved
by
lowering
admission
standards.
Rather,
the
academic
profile
of
the
student
body
has
strengthened,
as
demonstrated
by
an
increase
of
approximately
60
points
in
SAT
scores
over
the
past
three
years
among
incoming
freshmen.

Sweet
Briar
Is
Fighting
an
Up-Hill
Battle
.
<EOS>
Despite
a
beautiful
campus
,
dedicated
faculty
,
loyal
alumnae
and
a
significant
endowment
,
Sweet
Briar
College
is
closing
after
114
years
.
<EOS>
Too
few
students
were
choosing
Sweet
Briar
,
so
the
college
discounted
its
tuition
rate
,
a
move
that
exacerbated
its
financial
problems
but
did
not
succeed
in
attracting
enough
students
.
<EOS>
As
a
small
,
rural
,
liberal
arts
women
's
college
,
Sweet
Briar
was
fighting
an
up-hill
battle
against
many
trends
in
higher
education
.
<EOS>
Although
all
of
these
variables
probably
contributed
to
the
lack
of
student
interest
,
President
James
Jones
,
Jr.
acknowledged
that
declining
interest
in
single-sex
education
was
decisive
in
its
demise
.
<EOS>
Data
supports
this
conclusion
:
According
to
the
Women
's
College
Coalition
,
the
number
of
women
's
colleges
declined
from
230
to
little
more
than
40
in
the
last
half-century
.
<EOS>
By
many
measures
,
today
's
women
are
flourishing
in
higher
education
and
do
not
need
a
protected
environment
to
develop
their
intellectual
potential
.
<EOS>
Women
are
enrolled
in
higher
education
at
higher
rates
than
men
and
achieve
better
grades
.
<EOS>
Young
women
are
at
or
near
parity
in
many
``
traditionally
male
''
professions
including
law
and
medicine
.
<EOS>
While
women
are
still
underrepresented
in
positions
of
leadership
and
in
some
,
but
not
all
,
math-intensive
disciplines
,
there
is
no
data
to
support
the
myth
that
single-sex
colleges
prepare
women
better
to
become
leaders
in
our
co-ed
world
or
that
their
graduates
are
more
likely
to
choose
math-intensive
career
options
.
<EOS>
The
popular
idea
that
single-sex
education
benefits
women
comes
from
anecdotes
about
female
leaders
who
were
educated
in
an
era
when
elite
colleges
did
not
admit
them
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
Hillary
Clinton
attended
Wellesley
College
,
but
she
also
graduated
from
Yale
Law
School
,
which
was
co-ed
.
