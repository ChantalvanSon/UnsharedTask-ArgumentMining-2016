COMMENT:
You
have
a
nice
parent.^^
<EOS>
Don'
t
Limit
Your
Teen
's
Screen
Time
.
<EOS>
Some
children
grow
up
wanting
to
play
baseball
all
day
,
but
I
wanted
to
play
Castlevania
and
Super
Mario
Brothers
.
<EOS>
Sadly
,
my
parents
believed
I
'd
fry
my
brain
for
the
love
of
videogames
,
so
I
was
limited
to
an
hour
of
screen
time
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
But
that
only
fueled
covert
binging
.
<EOS>
Every
time
I
was
at
a
friend
's
house
,
we
'd
spend
the
whole
time
glued
to
the
Nintendo
system
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
at
family
reunions
,
my
cousins
and
I
would
fight
over
who
got
to
play
next
,
and
when
my
parents
went
out
of
town
,
it
was
a
no-sleep
videogame
free-for-all
.
<EOS>
I
look
back
on
those
years
and
wonder
why
my
parents
thought
that
videogames
were
hurtful
to
my
youth
.
<EOS>
They
taught
me
how
to
tell
stories
,
create
worlds
and
even
how
to
save
and
spend
money
.
<EOS>
Videogames
were
my
first
real
exposure
to
programming
,
and
they
helped
me
realize
my
career
in
technology
.
<EOS>
Regardless
,
we
are
in
a
different
era
.
<EOS>
Today
,
technology
is
so
prevalent
,
it
's
hard
to
keep
it
away
from
children
and
teenagers
.
<EOS>
But
I
don'
t
think
we
should
even
try
.
<EOS>
If
we
restrict
our
kids
'
access
,
while
we
're
emailing
from
an
Apple
Watch
,
they
won'
t
respect
the
rules
when
they
have
a
chance
to
get
around
them
.
<EOS>
As
an
experiment
,
I
stopped
restricting
my
children
's
screen
time
in
my
house
,
and
immediately
saw
results
at
a
recent
family
reunion
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
lives
in
a
strict
,
screen-regulated
home
.
<EOS>
So
,
a
trip
to
Grandma
's
-
where
there
are
no
restrictions
or
parental
controls
-
means
unlimited
SpongeBob
.
<EOS>
While
my
kids
were
out
playing
with
their
cousins
in
the
backyard
,
my
nephew
was
locked
on
the
TV
for
the
entire
evening
.
<EOS>
This
wasn'
t
an
opportunity
for
my
kids
to
binge
on
tech
because
they
couldn'
t
otherwise
-
they
were
more
excited
to
spend
time
with
cousins
they
never
see
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
kids
will
still
binge
.
<EOS>
Adults
binge
.
<EOS>
Netflix
has
built
an
entire
viewing
model
around
binging
.
<EOS>
But
allowing
children
and
teens
to
regulate
their
behavior
like
adults
gives
them
room
to
naturally
modify
their
own
habits
.
<EOS>
Plus
,
many
kids
do
learn
social
and
technical
skills
through
screen
time
,
even
more
so
now
then
when
I
was
growing
up
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
the
vast
majority
of
digital
gaming
today
is
a
social
event
:
Our
kids
are
growing
relationships
online
that
often
blossom
into
lifelong
friendships.
(
Anecdotally
,
I
met
many
of
my
friends
through
online
games
and
even
saw
two
-
a
couple
who
met
through
a
World
of
Warcraft
raid
-
end
up
happily
married.
)
<EOS>
Technology
is
not
going
away
or
becoming
less
popular
.
<EOS>
We
should
let
our
teenagers
build
on
MineCraft
,
mess
around
in
Photoshop
,
and
make
music
in
GarageBand
.
<EOS>
Eliminating
screen
time
is
a
thing
of
the
past
,
and
if
we
want
to
stay
technically
savvy
through
our
60s
,
our
kids
will
be
the
ones
to
teach
us
all
the
new
tricks
.
