COMMENT:
You
keep
saying
this
as
if
students
in
single-sex
institutions
don't
ride
the
bus,
don't
go
to
the
movies,
don't
read
books,
don't
have
relationships
with
members
of
the
opposite
sex,
don't
have
relatives
of
the
opposite
sex
--
heck,
do
you
think
they
don't
watch
TV
as
well?
They
don't
live
in
bubbles!
Even
if
the
classroom
is
a
supportive
environment
in
which
students
can
develop
confidence
and
independence
of
thought
and
action
without
the
distraction
of
young
women/young
men,
that
does
not
equal
isolation.

The
Freeing
Powers
of
Single-Sex
Education
.
<EOS>
Years
ago
,
during
a
classroom
visit
,
I
observed
a
small
group
of
black
and
Latino
high
school
boys
sitting
at
their
desks
looking
into
handheld
mirrors
.
<EOS>
They
were
tasked
with
answering
the
question
,
``
What
do
you
see
?
''
<EOS>
One
boy
said
,
``
I
see
an
ugly
face
.
''
<EOS>
Another
said
,
``
I
see
a
big
nose
.
''
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
many
moments
I
observed
in
single-sex
schools
where
black
and
Latino
boys
felt
comfortable
,
and
allowed
,
to
express
their
emotions
,
changing
notions
about
a
one
dimensional
image
of
masculinity
.
<EOS>
Our
society
is
partly
responsible
for
the
ways
in
which
gender-based
expectations
can
be
reinforced
and
,
over
time
,
those
expectations
can
help
create
vulnerable
situations
that
lead
to
limited
economic
mobility
,
job
opportunity
and
leadership
development
.
<EOS>
A
benefit
of
single-sex
environments
is
the
opportunity
for
cognitive
expansion
that
can
exist
alongside
multifaceted
displays
of
masculinity
and
femininity
.
<EOS>
In
single-sex
education
,
teachers
make
an
understanding
of
race
,
ethnicity
,
linguistic
diversity
,
masculinity
,
femininity
and
sexuality
a
profound
part
of
their
educational
mission
.
<EOS>
Such
identity-driven
missions
create
protective
environments
,
like
the
ones
found
in
single-sex
high
schools
like
Urban
Prep
Academy
and
Eagle
Academy
,
and
colleges
like
Bryn
Mawr
,
Spelman
and
Morehouse
.
<EOS>
Overall
,
the
closing
of
single-sex
colleges
like
Sweet
Briar
may
be
more
indicative
of
economic
and
demographic
dynamics
-
stagnant
high
school
graduation
and
college
readiness
,
increasing
college
costs
and
the
rise
in
online
education
-
rather
than
a
drop
in
importance
and
relevance
for
environments
where
``
Who
I
am
''
and
``
Who
I
want
to
be
''
take
center
stage
.
<EOS>
Those
questions
,
safely
explored
,
allow
students
to
develop
in
healthy
cognitive
,
social
and
emotional
ways
,
with
gender
nonconforming
values
.
