COMMENT:
Being
an
international
student
isn't
easy,
given
our
complex
culture
and
language.
Assistance
must
come
from
numerous
sources
to
aid
these
young
people
embarking
on
life's
journey.
A
new
award-winning
worldwide
book/ebook
that
aids
anyone
coming
to
the
US
is
"What
Foreigners
Need
To
Know
About
America
From
A
To
Z:
How
to
Understand
Crazy
American
Culture,
People,
Government,
Business,
Language
and
More."
It
is
used
in
foreign
Fulbright
student
programs
and
endorsed
worldwide
by
ambassadors,
educators,
and
editors.
A
chapter
on
education
explains
how
to
be
accepted
to
an
American
university
and
cope
with
a
confusing
new
culture,
friendship
process
and
daunting
classroom
differences.
Some
stay
after
graduation.
It
has
chapters
that
explain
how
US
businesses
operate
and
how
to
get
a
job
(which
differs
from
most
countries),
a
must
for
those
who
want
to
work
with/for
an
American
firm
here
or
overseas.
It
also
has
chapters
that
identify
the
most
common
English
grammar
and
speech
problems
foreigners
have
and
tips
for
easily
overcoming
them,
the
number
one
stumbling
block
they
say
they
have
to
succeeding
here.
Most
struggle
in
their
efforts
and
need
guidance
from
schools'
international
departments,
immigration
protection,
host
families,
concerned
neighbors
and
fellow
students,
and
informative
books
like
this
to
extend
a
cultural
helping
hand
so
we
all
have
a
win-win
situation.
Good
luck
to
all
wherever
you
study!

Immigrants
Bolster
Academic
and
Civic
Engagement
in
the
U.
S.
<EOS>
Rather
than
draining
American
society
of
resources
,
immigrants
significantly
enhance
the
economic
,
educational
and
civic
development
of
this
country
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
immigrants
have
a
limited
,
if
any
,
effect
on
job
growth
for
native-born
U.
S.
workers
.
<EOS>
But
they
do
add
to
the
economy
greatly
.
<EOS>
In
recent
years
,
foreign-born
immigrants
have
established
a
disproportionately
large
share
of
small
businesses
,
start-ups
in
Silicon
Valley
,
and
international
patents
.
<EOS>
In
some
of
the
nation
's
largest
cities
,
including
New
York
and
Los
Angeles
,
immigrant
residents
who
are
members
of
the
work
force
account
for
a
significant
amount
of
economic
productivity
.
<EOS>
Contrary
to
common
assumptions
,
legal
and
undocumented
immigrant
workers
typically
do
pay
taxes
,
including
on
their
incomes
,
just
as
U.
S.
citizens
do
.
<EOS>
And
immigrants
,
both
legal
and
undocumented
,
are
less
likely
to
commit
serious
crimes
.
<EOS>
When
it
comes
to
education
,
my
particular
area
of
study
,
recent
immigrants
overall
tend
to
perform
better
on
several
educational
outcomes
than
native-born
counterparts
whose
families
have
resided
in
the
U.
S.
for
longer
.
<EOS>
My
colleague
Johnelle
Sparks
and
I
have
found
that
first-generation
immigrant
students
enrolled
in
four-year
colleges
or
universities
are
actually
more
likely
than
other
students
to
finish
their
bachelor
's
degrees
within
six
years
.
<EOS>
Undocumented
immigrant
students
in
both
the
K-12
and
college
systems
demonstrate
significant
resilience
,
academic
engagement
in
their
studies
and
civic
involvement
-
often
serving
as
leaders
in
their
schools
.
<EOS>
In
a
country
where
the
historically
predominant
white
racial/ethnic
group
is
aging
rapidly
,
recent
immigrants
infuse
the
American
work
force
with
a
younger
population
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
Latinos
,
who
are
the
largest
immigrant
group
,
had
an
average
age
of
27
years
old
in
the
2010
Census
,
compared
with
the
average
white
age
of
42
.
<EOS>
Demographers
have
called
the
crucial
capacity
to
replenish
an
aging
labor
market
with
younger
individuals
the
``
demographic
dividend
''
-
It
is
immigrants
who
significantly
sustain
the
population
of
the
U.
S.
work
force
.
<EOS>
That
is
not
to
say
that
many
immigrant
students
don'
t
face
challenges
in
academic
achievement
and
educational
attainment
,
both
at
the
K-12
and
postsecondary
levels
.
<EOS>
They
often
have
less
familiarity
with
American
culture
(
often
including
limited
English
proficiency
)
,
come
from
lower
socioeconomic
backgrounds
,
and
attend
schools
that
are
not
well-resourced
.
<EOS>
But
ample
research
indicates
that
,
given
the
right
educational
support
,
immigrant
students
can
succeed
-
a
boon
for
the
economy
.
<EOS>
