COMMENT:
Alison,
you
are
not
answering
an
important
question
here.
Why
can't
the
colleges
and
universities
provide
better
data?
Why
not
create
better
evaluations,
not
the
boilerplate
ones
the
institutions
and
rate
your
professor
provide,
and
make
them
available
to
students?
The
data
from
those
surveys
will
surely
be
more
accurate;
however,
if
we
are
being
honest,
rate
your
professor
is
not
about
the
accuracy
of
data.
This
is
information
for
students
who
want
to
find
the
easiest
professor.
Reread
what
the
author
of
this
article
said,
Mr.
Stankiewicz
brings
up
the
cost
of
higher
education
within
the
context
of
judging
one
educator
over
another.
It
equates
higher
education
with
prompt
service
at
a
restaurant.
Which
professor
will
the
majority
of
students
pick
under
those
circumstances?
The
one
who
challenges
them?
One
of
the
most
important
responsibilities
that
professors
have
is
assessing
the
work
of
their
students,
yet
we
know
that
a
minority
of
students
welcome
challenging
work
and
an
honest
evaluation
of
their
work.
Rate
your
professor
has
made
it
more
and
more
difficult
for
professors
without
tenure
to
be
honest.
You're
making,
moreover,
a
large
assumption.
Does
not
the
background
and
education
of
those
readers
vary
from
one
institution
to
another?
Indeed,
I
would
not
even
trust
the
administrators
at
my
college
to
identify
a
fair
evaluation
from
rate
your
professor.
No,
what
we
need
is
better
information
about
the
instructor.
The
professor
might
find
it
useful.

For

I
'll
do

For
the
2015-16
academic
year
at
Ohio
State
's
Columbus
campus
,
full-time
tuition
and
fees
for
in-state
residents
is
estimated
at
$
10,037
-
or
$
5,018.50
a
semester
.
<EOS>
If
an
in-state
resident
enrolls
in
the
typical
five
classes
per
semester
,
they
're
paying
more
than
$
1,000
per
course
.
<EOS>
That
's
no
small
purchase
.
<EOS>
To
blindly
trust
that
I
am
spending
money
to
enroll
in
a
class
taught
by
a
professor
who
is
a
good
teacher
,
especially
in
my
major
,
would
be
foolish
.
<EOS>
The
reality
is
some
professors

job
than
others
