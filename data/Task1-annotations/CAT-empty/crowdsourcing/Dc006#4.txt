COMMENT:
Dr.
Lupia's
argument
is
the
one
I
found
myself
agreeing
with
the
most,
as
it
considers
what
the
alternative
(the
absence
of
polls)
would
look
like
and
takes
into
account
the
incentives
of
information
producers
and
consumers
that
would
persist
in
the
absence
of
polls.
I'd
add
two
ways
we
might
help
the
situation.
First,
we
need
increased
efforts
to
help
the
public
understand
the
limitations
of
polls,
(the
ways
in
which
they
are
imperfect,
what
makes
them
imperfect,
etc.),
which
is
really
part
of
the
larger
projects
of
increasing
media
literacy
and
numeracy.
Second,
maybe
there's
some
way
of
addressing
the
incentives
of
polling
orgs,
media
outlets,
and
even
info
consumers
to
make
accurate
assessments
and
predictions
about
public
opinion.
The
current
system
doesn't
adequately
punish
inaccurate
assessment/predictions.
I
think
Brian
Nosek
and
Phil
Tetlock
are
working
on
this.
Better
and
more
highly
visible
"report
cards"
for
polls
might
improve
the
situation.

Polls
Can
Give
People
a
Stronger
Voice
.
<EOS>
Polls
are
a
popular
whipping-boy
in
politics
.
<EOS>
They
are
blamed
for
politicians
'
bad
decisions
and
the
poor
state
of
democracy
.
<EOS>
This
,
despite
the
fact
that
in
most
elections
in
America
,
which
occur
at
the
local
level
,
there
are
no
polls
because
candidates
can'
t
afford
them
or
the
locality
is
so
small
that
you
really
don'
t
need
a
poll
.
<EOS>
Even
without
polls
,
the
same
complaints
emerge
.
<EOS>
Many
people
complain
about
their
local
politicians
'
bad
decisions
and
the
poor
state
of
democracy
.
<EOS>
People
complain
because
politics
entails
conflicts
that
result
in
lots
of
people
not
getting
what
they
want
(
i.e.
,
they
lose
elections
or
legislative
votes
)
.
<EOS>
Many
people
who
don'
t
get
what
they
want
need
something
to
blame
-
so
they
blame
the
polls
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
that
polls
are
destroying
democracy
,
then
think
about
an
alternative
.
<EOS>
Without
polls
,
politicians
,
special
interests
and
certain
members
of
the
news
media
would
still
have
strong
incentives
to
make
forceful
claims
about
the
public
's
views
.
<EOS>
Unconstrained
by
credible
polling
data
,
these
individuals
could
spin
incredible
stories
about
the
great
public
support
for
their
endeavors
.
<EOS>
This
,
by
the
way
,
is
not
a
hypothetical
situation
.
<EOS>
It
is
exactly
how
claims
about
public
opinion
are
circulated
and
adjudicated
in
a
range
of
democratic
and
authoritarian
regimes
that
lack
credible
polling
organizations
.
<EOS>
Without
good
polls
,
it
is
difficult
or
impossible
to
confront
bold
claims
by
powerful
people
.
<EOS>
Ask
Vladimir
Putin
.
<EOS>
Polls
are
imperfect
.
<EOS>
They
always
have
been
.
<EOS>
It
has
always
been
challenging
to
draw
accurate
inferences
about
a
large
population
by
interviewing
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
population
.
<EOS>
The
best
pollsters
understand
this
.
<EOS>
Professional
polling
organizations
,
such
as
the
American
Association
of
Public
Opinion
Researchers
,
work
hard
to
help
polling
organizations
establish
rigorous
best
practices
and
help
individuals
learn
as
much
as
possible
from
polling
data
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
many
second-rate
polling
organizations
try
to
pass
themselves
off
as
credible
sources
of
information
despite
their
cut-rate
methods
and
carelessness
in
reporting
critical
characteristics
of
their
data
(
such
as
response
rates
)
.
<EOS>
If
polling
organizations
are
honest
about
what
they
have
,
and
if
media
organizations
do
their
part
and
help
their
audiences
differentiate
reliable
polls
from
unreliable
polls
,
polls
can
strengthen
democracy
by
providing
important
information
about
what
citizens
want
and
think
.
