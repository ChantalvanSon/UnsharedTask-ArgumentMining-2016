COMMENT:
I
never
would
have
been
coerced
into
treatment.
At
22,
I
was
a
drug
addict
who
worked
out,
I
think
back
now,
what
was
I?
A
walking
speed
ball?
I
asked
to
get
high
the
first
time,
yes
I
was
afraid
of
needles,
so
I
closed
my
eyes.
I
remember
the
smell.
My
friends
are
all
dead.
I
am
not
sure
how
or
why
I
survived.
Maybe
the
departure
of
my
then
boyfriend
he
left
for
Florida.
Oh
yes,
he
wanted
me
to
go,
he
asked
me!
I
told
him
I
had
to
ask
my
father,
so
I
did,
my
father
said,
"Go
ahead,
I
wash
my
hands
of
you!"
I
did
not
want
to
lose
my
father's
love.
I
told
him
my
father
said
no!
When
he
drove
away,
I
felt
a
huge
weight
off
my
shoulders.
Not
for
any
reason
other
than
freedom.
I
got
that
same
feeling
when
my
youngest
went
off
to
college.
I
could
do
what
ever
I
wanted
whenever
I
wanted.
I
continued
to
get
high,
god
I
loved
not
feeling
anything.
The
warm
rush
in
the
vein
and
away
feeling
went.
I
would
disappear
for
days
for
no
apparent
reason,
just
didn't
feel
like
home
was
where
I
wanted
to
be.
My
father
was
and
is
the
most
loving
person,
he
never
gave
up
on
me.
Mike
Barnicle
actually
saved
my
life.
A
quick
interview
on
the
shooting
galleries
on
Sonoma
St
in
Boston.
I
had
just
gotten
high
in
the
best
shape,
tan
had
my
roller
skates
on
ready
to
go
and
I
sat
and
watched
while
waiting
for
my
friends
to
finish.
Freaked
me
out
the
open
sores
on
the
guards
legs.
He
provided
the
works
for
a
taste.
I
began
to
look
at
life
differently.
I
wanted
my
father
to
be
proud.
Its
been
a
long
road.

Attract
Patients
to
Addiction
Treatment
,
Don'
t
Force
Them
Into
It
.
<EOS>
To
improve
both
addiction
treatment
access
and
success
,
we
need
less
coercion
,
not
more
.
<EOS>
Contrary
to
stereotype
,
by
the
time
addiction
sets
in
,
drug
use
isn'
t
particularly
pleasurable
and
many
people
with
addictions
are
well
aware
that
their
lives
have
gone
wrong
.
<EOS>
Sadly
,
they
also
know
that
treatment
is
often
designed
to
be
``
tough
love
''
-
and
is
not
only
likely
to
be
painful
,
but
ineffective
.
<EOS>
Would
you
seek
such
help
with
so
little
hope
?
<EOS>
In
fact
,
research
shows
that
the
most
effective
addiction
therapies
are
kind
,
welcoming
and
supportive
,
not
harsh
or
confrontational
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
hard
to
create
a
warm
atmosphere
in
a
setting
where
a
third
to
half
and
sometimes
more
of
participants
are
legally
mandated
and
staff
is
poorly
trained
and
underpaid
.
<EOS>
When
patients
consistently
avoid
other
types
of
care
,
providers
make
it
more
attractive
,
just
as
marketers
do
with
unwanted
consumer
products
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
decades
of
seeing
force
as
the
only
way
to
motivate
addicted
people
have
created
a
largely
inhospitable
system
that
views
harsh
and
disrespectful
treatment
as
not
only
acceptable
,
but
also
necessary
to
get
patients
to
realize
that
they
have
``
hit
bottom
.
''
<EOS>
This
,
in
turn
,
leads
to
calls
for
more
coercion
when
people
,
quite
reasonably
,
choose
not
to
enter
or
drop
out
,
creating
a
vicious
cycle
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
because
so
many
people
with
addictions
don'
t
attend
voluntarily
,
programs
have
little
incentive
to
become
user-friendly
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
goes
to
jail
if
rehab
fails
isn'
t
the
head
of
the
institution
or
its
counselors
,
it
's
the
patient
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
always
another
warm
body
from
the
justice
system
to
fill
empty
slots
,
when
failure
is
always
the
patient
's
fault
.
<EOS>
This
dysfunctional
system
further
stigmatizes
addiction
by
implying
that
punishment
is
necessary
in
treatment
,
unlike
for
any
other
disorder
.
<EOS>
Some
programs
,
to
their
great
credit
,
realized
the
need
for
change
when
AIDS
made
reaching
active
drug
users
to
reduce
needle
sharing
an
urgent
task
.
<EOS>
They
discovered
that
,
just
like
grandma
said
,
you
attract
more
flies
with
honey
than
with
vinegar
.
<EOS>
And
contrary
to
claims
that
coercion
is
necessary
,
research
on
needle
exchange
and
other
``
harm
reduction
''
programs
shows
that
they
attract
people
into
recovery
,
rather
than
extending
addiction
.
<EOS>
One
Vancouver
harm
reduction
program
got
57
percent
of
participants
into
treatment
.
<EOS>
To
most
effectively
use
our
limited
resources
,
we
need
treatment
that
attracts
patients
without
lazily
relying
on
coercion
.
<EOS>
Not
only
is
this
more
humane
,
it
's
also
cheaper
and
more
likely
to
result
in
lasting
recovery
.
<EOS>
