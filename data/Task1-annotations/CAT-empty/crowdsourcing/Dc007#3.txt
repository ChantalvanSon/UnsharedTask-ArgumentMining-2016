COMMENT:
Rating
professors
is
not
a
good
idea.
It
demotivates
faculty.
It
is
like
rating
students
for
others
to
decide
who
to
be
friends
with.
Sound
silly,
right?
It
is
the
same
with
rating
professors.
Everyone
has
to
decide
for
himself
or
herself
without
the
bias
provided
by
these
ratings.
Knowledge
will
not
get
into
your
head
unless
otherwise
there
is
reverence
and
respect
for
the
teacher.
Let
us
not
equate
faculty
with
movies.
Even
there,
serious
movie
goers
will
not
be
watching
for
movie
ratings.
You
will
lose
the
idea
of
discovery
and
personal
experience.

Ratings

Before
making
a
notable
purchase
or
investment
,
consumers
often
consult
reviews
from
others
.
<EOS>
Whether
buying
a
new
car
or
a
home
appliance
,
people
want
to
make
informed
decisions
.
<EOS>
When
college
students
sign
up
for
classes
taught
by
specific
professors
,
we
are
consumers
too
.
<EOS>
We
pay
tuition
for
classes
that
help
us
gain
an
education
and
,
ultimately
,
a
diploma
.
<EOS>
We
need
to
be
able
to
make
informed
decisions
about
the
classes
we
pay
for

Just
as
there
are
good
and
bad
refrigerators

there
are
good

professors

For
college

looking
for
the
right
classroom
instructor

there
's
Rate
My
Professors
--
4
million
college
students
use
it
every
month
.
<EOS>
For
me
,
it
's
not
about
signing
up
for
an
easy
``
A.
''
<EOS>
I
'll
do
my
best
no
matter
who
delivers
the
lectures
,
but
it
helps
to
have
a
professor
who
can
teach
and
inspire
.
<EOS>
At
Ohio
State
,
the
list
of
professors
is
extensive
.
<EOS>
Rate
My
Professors
helps
me
narrow
down
my
choices
.
<EOS>
It
tells
me
what
my
peers
think
of
the
various
instructors
.
<EOS>
The
university
has
students
evaluate
professors
,
but
those
responses
aren'
t
available
to
us
.
<EOS>
Why
shouldn'
t
nursing
students
try
to
find
the
best
instructor
for
their
medical
terminology
class
?
<EOS>
That
class
has
implications
beyond
a
line
on
a
transcript

<EOS>
For
the
2015-16
academic
year
at
Ohio
State
's
Columbus
campus
,
full-time
tuition
and
fees
for
in-state
residents
is
estimated
at
$
10,037
-
or
$
5,018.50
a
semester
.
<EOS>
If
an
in-state
resident
enrolls
in
the
typical
five
classes
per
semester
,
they
're
paying
more
than
$
1,000
per
course
.
<EOS>
That
's
no
small
purchase
.
<EOS>
To
blindly
trust
that
I
am
spending
money
to
enroll
in
a
class
taught
by
a
professor
who
is
a
good
teacher
,
especially
in
my
major
,
would
be
foolish
.
<EOS>
The
reality
is
some
professors
do
a
better
job
than
others
,
and
Rate
My
Professors
helps
reveal
which
do
.
<EOS>
With
the
near-crippling
cost
of
tuition
,
Rate
My
Professors
is
a
valuable
tool
for
students
to
ensure
they
get
the
best
return
out
of
their
educational
investments
.
