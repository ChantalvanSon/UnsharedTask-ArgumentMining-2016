COMMENT:
I
disagree
with
your
assertion
that
polls
help
keep
our
democracy,
especially
since
most
poll
questions
are
written
in
a
manner
that
the
question
provides
the
answer
the
pollster
is
looking
for.
To
this
point,
I
read
the
summary
description
of
"Uninformed,"
and
although
I
have
not
yet
read
your
book,
I
have
serious
doubts
that
"educating"
the
public
on
policy
issues
will
be
an
effective
solution
to
the
problem
of
an
uninformed
electorate.
The
fact
is
the
GOP
has
already
perfected
the
method
for
educating
the
public,
by
group
testing
specific
words,
which
helps
them
reduce
all
policy
issues
down
to
simplistic
slogans
which
will
appeal
to
the
average
voter.
Keeping
the
message
short
and
to
the
point
they
are
trying
make
has
worked
for
years,
and
it
is
one
reason
the
GOP
controls
a
substantial
number
of
State
governments,
as
well
as
the
current
congress.
A
great
example
of
GOP
sloganeering
is
that
29%
of
Americans
polled
still
believe
he
is
a
Muslim.

Can

Polls
are
a
popular
whipping-boy
in
politics
.
<EOS>
They
are
blamed
for
politicians
'
bad
decisions
and
the
poor
state
of
democracy
.
<EOS>
This
,
despite
the
fact
that
in
most
elections
in
America
,
which
occur
at
the
local
level
,
there
are
no
polls
because
candidates
can'
t
afford
them
or
the
locality
is
so
small
that
you
really
don'
t
need
a
poll
.
<EOS>
Even
without
polls
,
the
same
complaints
emerge
.
<EOS>
Many
people
complain
about
their
local
politicians
'
bad
decisions
and
the
poor
state
of
democracy
.
<EOS>
People
complain
because
politics
entails
conflicts
that
result
in
lots
of
people
not
getting
what
they
want
(
i.e.
,
they
lose
elections
or
legislative
votes
)
.
<EOS>
Many
people
who
don'
t
get
what
they
want
need
something
to
blame
-
so
they
blame
the
polls
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
that
polls
are
destroying
democracy
,
then
think
about
an
alternative
.
<EOS>
Without
polls
,
politicians
,
special
interests
and
certain
members
of
the
news
media
would
still
have
strong
incentives
to
make
forceful
claims
about
the
public
's
views
.
<EOS>
Unconstrained
by
credible
polling
data
,
these
individuals
could
spin
incredible
stories
about
the
great
public
support
for
their
endeavors
.
<EOS>
This
,
by
the
way
,
is
not
a
hypothetical
situation
.
<EOS>
It
is
exactly
how
claims
about
public
opinion
are
circulated
and
adjudicated
in
a
range
of
democratic
and
authoritarian
regimes
that
lack
credible
polling
organizations
.
<EOS>
Without
good
polls
,
it
is
difficult
or
impossible
to
confront
bold
claims
by
powerful
people
.
<EOS>
Ask
Vladimir
Putin

<EOS>
Polls
are
imperfect
.
<EOS>
They
always
have
been
.
<EOS>
It
has
always
been
challenging
to
draw
accurate
inferences
about
a
large
population
by
interviewing
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
population
.
<EOS>
The
best
pollsters
understand
this
.
<EOS>
Professional
polling
organizations
,
such
as
the
American
Association
of
Public
Opinion
Researchers
,
work
hard
to
help
polling
organizations
establish
rigorous
best
practices
and
help
individuals
learn
as
much
as
possible
from
polling
data
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
many
second-rate
polling
organizations
try
to
pass
themselves
off
as
credible
sources
of
information
despite
their
cut-rate
methods
and
carelessness
in
reporting
critical
characteristics
of
their
data
(
such
as
response
rates
)
.
<EOS>
If
polling
organizations
are
honest
about
what
they
have
,
and
if
media
organizations
do
their
part
and
help
their
audiences
differentiate
reliable
polls
from
unreliable
polls
,
polls
can
strengthen
democracy
by
providing
important
information
about
what
citizens
want
and
think
.
