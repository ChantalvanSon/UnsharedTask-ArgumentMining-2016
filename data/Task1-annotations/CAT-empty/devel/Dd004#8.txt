COMMENT:
Had
too
much
to
drink?
Drove
yourself
to
the
bar?
Uber.
Lyft.
They'll
take
you
home,
and
bring
you
back
the
next
day.
A
DUI
costs
thousands,
and
could
alter
lives.
Pay
a
couple
of
bucks
and
duck
the
issue
entirely.
THEN
you
can
think
about
your
drinking
habits.
Don't
blame
the
marketing
plans
of
the
bar,
and
for
God's
sake
don't
go
to
the
government
looking
for
help;
we
have
enough
regulations...

There
's
Nothing
'
Happy
'
About
Drunken
Driving
Deaths
.

I
own
a
pizzeria/brewpub
in
the
Wicker
Park
neighborhood
of
Chicago
.
<EOS>
We
've
won
24
medals
at
the
Great
American
Beer
Festival
and
World
Beer
Cup
.
<EOS>
I
love
great
beer
and
I
enjoy
going
out
and
having
fun
in
a
responsible
manner
.
<EOS>
I
strongly
oppose
the
reinstitution
of
happy
hours
in
Illinois
.
<EOS>
Happy
hours
were
banned
in
Illinois
in
1989
for
good
reason
:
Happy
hour
discounts
encouraged
excessive
drinking
during
a
short
period
of
time
.
<EOS>
People
were
getting
drunk
off
cheap
drinks
,
driving
drunk
and
causing
harm
(
and
sometimes
death
)
to
themselves
and
others
.
<EOS>
When
I
wrote
about
my
opposition
to
happy
hours
on
my
Facebook
page
last
week
,
a
friend
told
me
of
the
tragic
death
of
her
close
friend
,
a
freshman
at
Eastern
Illinois
University
,
who
was
on
her
way
home
for
Thanksgiving
break
in
1987
when
the
car
she
was
riding
in
was
hit
by
a
driver
who
had
just
left
a
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
Supporters
of
the
bill
say
it
will
let
Chicago
compete
with
other
cities
for
tourist
dollars
.
<EOS>
But
will
tourists
flock
to
Chicago
because
they
can
drink
more
for
less
at
happy
hour
?
<EOS>
Right
.
<EOS>
Forget
about
the
Art
Institute
.
<EOS>
Forget
about
the
Museum
of

the
Shedd
Aquarium
,
Navy
Pier
,
great
food
,
the
Cubs
,
the

Stanley

champion
Blackhawks
,
the

the

Only
cheap
drinks
at
happy
hour
lure
the
big
spenders
to
the
Windy
City

Last
time
I
listened
to
Frank
Sinatra
's
``
Chicago
,
''
there
was
no
mention
of
cheap
happy
hour
drinks
.
<EOS>
And
,
frankly
,
people
are
more
likely
to
come
to
Chicago
to
see
that
man
who
danced
with
his
wife
than
they
are
to
come
here
to
binge
cheaply
at
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
Chicago
toddles
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
$
1
drinks
between
5
and
7
.
<EOS>
The
competition
will
not
be
between
Chicago
and
San
Francisco
and
Miami
for
tourist
dollars
but
between
watering
holes
seeking
to
out-happy
hour
each
other
by
offering
the
most
intoxicating
drink
offers
,
as
it
was
in
the
halcyon
days
of
Chicago
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
According
to
the
United
States
Department
of
Transportation
,
there
were
393
alcohol-related
traffic
fatalities
in
Illinois
in
2012
-
a
year
in
which
happy
hour
was
outlawed
in
Illinois
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
to
say
that
the
reinstitution
of
happy
hour
,
with
its
drunken
hordes
stumbling
forth
onto
Illinois
'
roads
,
is
not
likely
to
make
Illinois
'
roads
safer
.
<EOS>
Let
's
not
trade
lives
for
revenues
.
<EOS>
Governor
Rauner
,
don'
t
sign
this
bill
.
