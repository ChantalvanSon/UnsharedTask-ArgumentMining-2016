Responsible
Service
Makes
Sense

Happy
Hour
Bans

<EOS>
In
the
beginning
of
my
career
as
a
bartender
,
I
worked
in
a
solid
establishment
with
great
food
and
beverages
that
offered
a
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
I
appreciated
it
because
it
brought
in
clientele
fairly
early
in
the
evening
when
bars
are
often
quiet
.
<EOS>
During
that
hour
,
the
average
check
was
two
drinks
per
person
,
and
they
frequently
would
order
an
appetizer
.
<EOS>
After
it
was
over
,
some
guests
stayed
on
and
ordered
a
meal
.
<EOS>
But
more
often
than
not
,
many
of
the
guests
made
their
way
home
without
much
fanfare
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
happy
hour
or
not
,
the
one
thing
that
I
was
always
diligent
about
was
serving
water
and
frequently
checking
in
with
my
guests
to
make
sure
that
they
were
in
good
shape
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
owners
was
always
on-premise
and
frequently
checked
in
at
the
bar
to
ensure
all
was
going
well
.
<EOS>
In
general
,
offering
food
and
water
and
frequent
check-in
's
with
one
's
patrons
is
not
just
a
good
preventative
--
at
the
core
,
it
's
simply
responsible
hospitality
.
<EOS>
At
this
point
in
my
career
as
an
bar
owner
,
I
can
appreciate
it
for
similar
reasons
.
<EOS>
From
a
financial
perspective
,
bars
can
often
be
fairly
quiet
places
the
first
hour
or
two
after
opening
.
<EOS>
Now
,
when
various
states
are
considering
a
minimum
wage
increase
to
$
15
an
hour
,
a
short
selection
of
drinks
offered
at
a
slight
discount
can
help
to
stimulate
business
and
offset
costs
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
bit
narrowminded
to
think
that
a
happy
hour
ban
is
going
to
drastically
reduce
problems
.
<EOS>
An
establishment
that
offers
food
can
avoid
happy
hour
restrictions
by
leaving
their
drinks
at
full-price
and
discounting
their
food
instead
.
<EOS>
A
guest
can
beat
the
system
by
simply
patronizing
a
bar
that
offers
inexpensive
drinks
during
all
of
its
hours
of
operations
.
<EOS>
We
should
instead
be
addressing
this
issue
at
the
core
with
responsible
service
.
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
happy
hour
bans
,
I
'd
like
to
see
legislature
that
requires
all
food
and
beverage
establishments
to
annually
certify
all
employees
who
serve
alcohol
through
an
accredited
alcohol
management
program
.
<EOS>
New
hires
should
be
put
through
the
program
before
they
start
.
<EOS>
I
've
participated
in
a
number
of
such
certifications
,
and
I
require
that
my
entire
staff
be
certified
.
<EOS>
Every
establishment
has
an
obligation
to
ensure
the
safety
of
its
guests
at
all
times
--
not
solely
during
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
